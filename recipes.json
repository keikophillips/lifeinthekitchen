I confess to being a ‘Breadie’ who can bore for Britain  consulting with fellow cultists.</p><p>I make my own sourdough loaf. A boast: my ‘starter’ is over 30 years old.. But, I also make a loaf or two which don’t require such forethought as sourdough, which make take 15-18 hours before the end product is ready, even though it  requires very little kneading.</p><p>So, here is a quicker bread which also needs very little effort and can be contemplated, assembled, finished in less than a long morning or an afternoon.. It also requires not very much yeast  and uses ordinary beer as a raising agent and flavour enhancer, The sugars and additional yeasts in the beer contribute to the taste and speed. For this recipe, I use very ordinary pale ale or light sort of beer- any kind will do. </p><p>I use mostly white flour, with only a quarter of the weight in whole meal, as I personally find too much brown flour in a loaf produces a stodgy, heavy loaf. But, that is my own personal preference; I leave the proportion of white to brown flour to you.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 6g dried yeast; 110ml warm water; 600g flour; 300ml beer; 12g (1 ½ tsp)salt.</p><p>Method: In a large bowl stir together 70g of the flour, the yeast and the warm water. Cover this mixture and leave it in a warmish spot for ½ hour. Then add the beer. Remaining flour and salt into the starter, incorporating it all by kneading briefly until it’s amalgamated. Cover the bowl and leave it to rise for 2 hours until it’s doubled in size. Then, with floury hands shape it into a loaf and place it on a floured baking sheet. Cover this very loosely and leave it to rise for ½ hours, while you heat your oven (220’C or 425’F). Slash a few slits in the middle of the loaf with a very sharp knife3 or razorblade, then bake for 30-35 minutes till golden. You can place a tray of warm water in the bottom of the oven to add a bit of steam, to encourage rising.</p><p>When done, cool on a rack.</p><p>                                                                                                     -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>"

Here is a simple recipe which can be served, first, hot, but when cold – say. the next day – are either good served on salad leaves or even better as a filling for a sandwich.</p><p>To clean them, (say, a litre of mussels for two servings), rinse them well in cold running water. Then, remove the threads tangling round their shells as well as any barnacles stuck to their shell. This can be done with a small sharp knife and is very important, as the barnacles may contain dead matter. Then rinse them well in a couple of changes of water, tapping them to discover any mussels which are open after rough treatment. Discard these. Now, cut up a few blades of celery, half an onion, some parsley stalks, and place them, with a bay leaf or two, and some peppercorns, in a large saucepan. Add a teacup of either cider, perry, white wine or vermouth, and bring this to the boil. Then, throw in the mussels, Cover the pot, and cook for a couple of minutes. Uncover the pot, stir them round, then recover the pot and cook for another two or three minutes. They should all be open. Remove the pot from the fire, and strain the mussels into a large bowl, but reserving the cooking juices. (I strain them into a colander),  then strain the juices directly into a small saucepan. Reduce these juices until you have just about two tablespoons of the mixture, which should be shiny and somewhat gloopy.  Shell the mussels and place them directly into this mixture, tossing them quickly. Spoon them into a bowl.</p><p>Make a sharpish vinaigrette using the juice of a lemon, a crushed clove of garlic, a finely chopped shallot, some chopped parsley and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard.  Gradually add a teacup of vegetable oil to this.  Spoon some of this vinaigrette over the cooked (and coated) mussels. You can serve this as is, or as a salad. But, it’s magic as a sandwich in sliced brown bread or a soft bap.</p><p>                                                                                                                   </p><p></p></body></html>"

I suggest that you make two of these potato cakes even if there is just one of you – the remaining ‘cake’ will keep well, chilled in the fridge, for up to three days, ready to be cooked just when you need it.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 440g potatoes (approximately a pound)- peeled, and if large, cut into reasonable chunks; 1 bay leaf (optional); salt, pepper, a little grated nutmeg; chopped parsley (from 2-3 stalks); a small amount of chopped onion (approximately a tablespoon; flour – a rounded tablespoon of flour; 1 egg; 50g cheese (I use strong cheddar); breadcrumbs (the ‘Panko’ ones from Howell’s deli are particularly good; a little paprika (to make it look golden; fat: bacon fat, dripping, vegetable oil- nothing fancy.</p><p></p><p>Method: Place the potato chunks and bay leaf in salted water to cover. Bring to the boil and cook until soft (approximately 20 minutes). Drain them well and place the back in the saucepan for a minute or two until they are quite dry. Then mash them well. Season well with the salt, pepper and nutmeg, then add the chopped parsley and onion. Mix together well, then add in the egg, then the flour. Cut the cheese into slices.</p><p>Now, cover a dinner plate with breadcrumbs. Sprinkle these with paprika. Divide this potato ‘dough in half, then halve them again. Mould one of these quarters into a large-ish round cake and place it on the breadcrumbed plate. Depress the centre of it slightly and cover it with half of the cheese. Then cover this up with the other quarter. Gently form it into a neat and circular cake. With a fish slice, turn this cake round so that you have breadcrumbed the bottom. Slide this onto a tray. Now, add a few more breadcrumbs and paprika to the plate and repeat the process with the remaining potato mixture and the cheese. You should end up with two good sized potato cakes, ready to cook.</p><p>Fry them in a nice hot pan, to which you’ve added a little oil, dripping or bacon fat, cooking them until they are golden on each side. They can keep in a low oven for a while, or cooked from cold, hours later. With salad, cooked greens, - an easy, trouble free meal.</p><p>                                                                        </p><p>                                                                              -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

This recipe came from a book published in the 60s which was an anthology of recipes culled from American collections of booklets put out as fundraisers by (mostly) rural women’s associations…. Included are contributions by the Mrs..Eisenhower and Nixon…..There are some very curious contributions: raspberry jelly (‘Jello’) salad, mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallow- but this biscuit is a terrific find. It calls for a lot of butter ,but then, will make somewhere around 100 cookies. The dough is rolled into long cylinders, then refrigerated, and then can be unwrapped, cut and baked at will. It stores – and freezes well.</p><p>Ingredients: 450g butter, at room temperature; 300g caster sugar; 1 egg; 2 tsp milk; 1 tsp vanilla; 500g flour; a pinch of salt.</p><p>Method: Cream the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, then add the egg, vanilla and milk. Finally, stir in the flour and salt. Chill this batter for approximately a half hour ,until it is able to be turned into cylinders. Make into several cylinders ,slightly bigger than 50p pieces (you can make these larger if you wish) directly onto Bakewell paper, which you roll up around the cylinders before refrigerating, at least overnight. Bake on trays lined with more Bakewell or greaseproof paper. You slice the dough as thinly as you can. And, in a moderately hot oven, they should take about 10 minutes to cook. When they are starting to brown around the edges, they are ready, though if you like them slightly more caramelized you can leave them a minute or so longer.</p><p></p><p>                                                                             -Carla Phillips</p><p>                                                           </p></body></html>"

Great on their own or combined with apples in pies and preserves, they also make a fine dry aperitif type wine. But for me, they are useful when used to make blackberry vinegar. This delicious combination of sweet and sour which has myriad undertones which make it the finest fruit vinegar around.Made with our local Whin Hill cider vinegar, it’s a winning combo.</p><p>You must leave the berries to soak in the vinegar for at least a month, ideally 6 weeks or longer. But once made and decanted into attractive bottles it’s a great present as well as a welcome addition to your larder. So, for each kilo of berries you will need a litre and a half of the vinegar. Leave the berries to soak in covered bucket , large bowl or big jar.</p><p>When you’re ready, strain off the vinegar. Leave the draining berries for long enough for them to yield as much liquid as possible. Then measure your liquid. For every litre use half the weight in sugar (any sort). Thus for a litre of vinegar, use 500 grams of sugar. Place the vinegar in a saucepan and immerse the sugar. Gradually bring it to the boil. Make sure the sugar is dissolved. Allow it to boil a minute or two, then remove from the heat. Pour this liquid into well washed narrow necked bottles (I use a measuring jug with a good spout for this),</p><p>This condiment is wonderful with game, liver and salads which include leftover savoury items. It can transform leftover gravy into a piquant sauce. Try it and see! </p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>SIMPLE BUT SUMPTUOUS</p><p></p><p>This is one of the nicest meat dishes I know of. First prepared for me, many years ago by Tom Faire, I think its origins are Italian. Its main ingredient is brisket of beef and its other ingredient - onions. Nothing more, and all depends on the quality of the meat – easy to succeed in this part of the world where there are individual, dedicated butchers who are all careful about the sources of their ingredients.</p><p>Nothing more is needed, other than a sprig or two of thyme (or dried thyme if the fresh stuff is not obtainable), and a tablespoon or so of olive oil. However, you do need lots of real time for this, even though no great effort is required.</p><p></p><p>You need whole brisket, and about a kilo of it, at least. This will provide for several meals –more later, about these- and you need a kilo of onions as well. First of all, slices the onions finely. Heat up a heavy bottomed saucepan, and then toss all the onions in it. Stir them well, as they start to steam, and when they are just starting to change colour, add the olive oil and thyme, and reduce the heat. Stir them occasionally as they cook gently, until they are a caramel shade. Season them with salt and pepper, then remove the onions from the pan and turn up the heat once again. </p><p> Now, brown the brisket thoroughly on all sides. Once this is done, remove the meat, add the onions, place the meat on top, then either cover the saucepan, reducing the heat underneath to the minimum possible, or place the covered saucepan in a very slow oven, or transfer the contents into an ovenproof casserole before placing it in a very slow oven. If you have a slow cooker, this is a time to use it.</p><p>Don’t add any liquid. And, take your time before looking at it; this recipe takes at least four to five hours to cook. I usually remove it from the heat, allowing it to cool completely. Then. I skim off most of the fat which has risen to the top before reheating it for about a half hour.It’s superb served with Yorkshire pudding and roasties. The onion gravy works a treat. Sliced thinly, it should be a faint pink colour in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Next day, the cold remains of the meat, thinly sliced, make perfect sandwiches. Then, there is a perfect cottage pie, using some of the gravy. And finally, if there is any of the sauce left, add some red wine to it, and a little water. Heat these up, place some croutons or dried bread on it, grate some gruyere cheese over the lot, and grill it briefly. Voila! Onion soup, French style!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                              -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p></body></html>"

These are a ‘good feed’ raw, just podded, wih an accompaniment of a a few shavings or slivers of  Peccorino, Parmesan or mature cheddar cheese. Good for a snack, or even an informal preliminary to a meal. This one was introduced to me by my Italian daughter-in-law.</p><p>In fact, if the broad beans are immature enough, you can treat them as if they were regular green beans, that is, cooking them briefly, draining them and serving with just a little butter.</p><p>My favourite way of cooking fresh, youngish broad beans is to pod them and throw them into fiercely boiling unsalted water for only three or four minutes. Then drain them, add salt and pepper and a tablespoon of cream or crème fraiche. Delicious!</p><p>Once the broad beans are large with tough skins, it’s worth skinning them once cooked. I know this is a bit tedious, but when the skins are discarded, the inner beans are very fine indeed – nice by themselves, but a gorgeous addition to an ordinary tossed salad. Here is a nice vinagrette for this sort of summer salad.</p><p>Ingredients: 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar; 1 clove of garlic; 1 small shallot; a handful of parsley; salt and pepper; 4-6 tablespoons of olive oil.</p><p>Method: Make this if you can with either a blender or stick blender. Mix together the vinegar with the garlic, shallot, parsley. Blend these well. Then trickle in the olive oil, and last of all season to taste.

This recipe dates from the time when grand chefs named sumptuous dishes after celebrities. Think Peach Melba or Omelette Arnold Bennett.</p><p>Anyway, the silky richness of this dish was particularly popular with diners in our restaurant; mostly because of the egg yolk addition rather than the cream and cheese which were more modest in amounts. The ingredients are simple enough but there are several stages to the dish, none difficult or requiring too much fiddling about, and indeed, it can be made well in advance.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients (for 4 people): 2 Large cooked chicken breasts; 250g small button mushrooms; ½  litre of milk; 250g chopped onions; 70g flour; 4 egg yolks; 100g butter; 1 tablespoon double cream; 50g grated gruyere or parmesan (or a mixture);2 teaspoons of sherry; salt; pepper; cayenne; nutmeg; paprika; a little more grated cheese for topping.</p><p></p><p>Method: Heat the chopped onion gradually in the milk. Bring it just to a simmer, then turn off the heat and let it steep until the liquid is cool. Meanwhile, remove the skin and bones from the chicken and chop it into smallish chunks.</p><p>Chop the mushrooms very, very finely. Without using any fat, cook them in a frying pan, stirring, until all their moisture has evaporated. This will take from 7 to 10 minutes.</p><p>Now make the first part of the sauce. Strain the milk, discarding the onions. Make a cream sauce with this liquid, half the butter and all the flour. Stir until it’s thickened, just starting to bubble, then season with the sherry, salt and pepper.</p><p>Now, whisk the egg yolks. Divide into two bowls. Add some of the cream sauce to one of these bowls, then stir this back into the whole sauce. Add a dash of cayenne and some grated nutmeg, and finally, the cream.</p><p>Add a third of this sauce to the chopped mushrooms and mix well. </p><p>As to the remaining sauces, add the rest of the egg yolks, most of the remaining butter and the grated cheese.</p><p>Now, to assemble. Coat the chicken chunks with the mushroom mixture and place these in a buttered gratin dish. Coat the whole with the remaining cheese sauce, then cover with the little bit of grated cheese, some paprika and the few dots of the remaining butter.</p><p>Bake this in a very hot oven for 12-15 minutes, then serve it with very plain but colourful vegetables: greens, carrots, etc. Very more-ish!</p><p>                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

Add 2 litres of water to them, then on top of the stove, bring it to the boil. Simmer for an hour and a half, then add 2 teaspoons of salt, the vegetables, and cook for an hour longer. Then, strain the soup.</p><p>For the dumplings: 75g of pulverised matzos (matzo meal); 2 eggs, separated; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold in the lightly beaten yolks, then the matzo meal and salt. Cover the bowl and chill for a half hour. Then bring a pan of water to the boil. Form the dumpling batter into smallish balls and drop them into the boiling water. Simmer them for 20 minutes. If you cook them in the actual soup they will soak up so much liquid that you won’t have enough soup to go round.</p><p> Just before you need to serve the soup, bring both pots to the boil, then slide the dumplings into the hot soup. Garnish with a little chopped parsley. </p><p>                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

Starting as a lecture and lantern slide show set at least a century ago, this took place on Friday evening at Wells Maltings. The author, a longtime Norfolk resident who lives locally has been touring the country with this performance.</p><p></p><p>It was entrancing. Diplomats (British and Chinese), soldiers, Chinese courtiers, sounds from the Dowager \\Empress. The distant and not so distant  sounds of gunfire – all brilliantly evoked. Greed, revenge, snobbery, prejudice, plus the knowledge of Chinese history and customs, all revealed in this portrayal of a momentous historical event which inevitably echoes today. We ignore history at our peril.</p><p>Narration, acting, sounds and strikingly attractive set and costumes were all faultless. It  seems amazing to be so fired up by this evocation of a historically remote event, but clear repercussions have trickled down to the present. This production is travelling all over the place. If possible, don’t miss it!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                          -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

Add in all the icing sugar and stir well until smooth, Then remove it all from the heat, keeping on stirring until it thickens into a spreadable paste. Place some of this paste onto one of the layers, spreading it rapidly and cover with the remaining half. \\finish  by icing the top and sides of the whole cake.

When I make it for a lot of people I will use a nine inch spring-form baking tin, and double the recipe, but if it’s for 8-10 people make it in an eight inch spring form tin.</p><p></p><p>Shortbread base- Ingredients: 25g hazelnuts, toasted, skins rubbed off; 3 tablespoons sugar; 75g  flour; 50g butter; 15g cocoa; pinch of salt</p><p>Method: Pulse the nuts in a processor with the sugar until the nuts are finely chopped. Add the rest of the ingredients and pulse until a dough forms. Press this into a 20cm (8 inch) springform pan. Prick it with a knife or fork all over, then bake for 20 minutes at 180’c.</p><p></p><p>Mousse- Make this while the base is cooling.-Ingredients: 1 teaspoon gelatine; 2 tablespoons of cold water; 150g chocolate hazelnut spread (Nutella); 120g Mascarpone: 350ml cream (double or whipping); 50g sugar; 75g cocoa</p><p>Method: Sprinkle the gelatine into the water and warm in a bowl immersed over hot water, leaving it to soften, then melted.

But a recent trip to New York City to visit my eldest daughter has changed my mind completely. She served the following recipe up, and like everyone else present, I couldn’t wait to get the recipe. As you will see, when you examine the ingredients, they are massively rich in chocolate. Please use decent chocolate, with at least 60% cocoa butter content! But, they are really easy and quick to make, and even though the original recipe called for massive slices, smaller and daintier slices seem fine to me.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 230g dark chocolate, 140g of it chopped or hammered into small chunks or shards; 125g butter; 250g sugar; 1 tsp vanilla essence; 90g plain flour; 2 eggs, at room temperature; a pinch of salt if you use unsalted butter. Use a 20cm (8inch) square baking tin or dish, lined with Bakewell paper.</p><p></p><p>Method: Melt the butter and 90g of the chocolate together- either in a microwave or a bowl set well above simmering water, Stir to blend, then remove from the heat. Mix together, in a  separate bowl, the eggs, sugar and flour. Then blend them with the butter-chocolate mixture, stir in the vanilla essence, and last of all, the remaining chocolate chunks. Put this into the baking tin or dish, and bake it in a moderately hot oven (180C or 350F) for 10-12 minutes – an inserted toothpick should come out clean.

Inevitably some of these will metamorph into ‘grown up’ courges...more of a culinary challenge. In that spirit I am offering up my recipe for sweet and sour pickled marrow. If you have a glut of small courgettes, you can use this recipe; you’ll need less in weight of the littler courgettes, and less time salting and pressing them, but they will turn out equally delicious. I’ve been handing out this recipe for about 50 years, but people still get in touch asking for it- and I am not sure whether I ever put it in ‘The Quay’.</p><p>Of course, if you have an overgrown courgette, once you have grated it, salted it, combined it with some chopped onion and squeezed some of the moisture out (I use a ‘J-Cloth’), you can add a bit of flour and an egg to it all, for a rissole or vegetable cake.Still, here is that recipe for a truly marvellous pickle.</p><p>Ingredients: approximately 1kg of marrow, courge or slightly less in weight (600gs) courgettes;600g onions,thinly sliced; 2-3 red peppers, finely sliced; 1 chilli, de-cored, de-seeded and finely chopped; 2 teaspoons of salt; 300ml cider vinegar, 450g sugar; 1 level teaspoon turmeric; 1 teaspoon of pickling spice, or ½ teaspoons each of celery seed and mustard seeds. </p><p>Method: If using marrow or courge, peel it scoop out the seeds and soft pith in the middle. Finely slice it into small chunks. For courgettes,simply slice into small, pickle style chunks. Then combine with the sliced onions, peppers and chilli in a large bowl, sprinkling them with the salt. Mix it all well, then place this in a colander. Place a plate over them and something heavy on top of this plate,and then leave it all to drain, for at least an hour or two. Overnight is fine.</p><p>In a large saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the cider vinegar over gentle heat. Add the spices and turmeric, and bring it to the boil. Tip the vegetables into the saucepan and up the heat, bringing it all to a heavy boil. Cook for five minutes or so, until the marrow-courgette pieces look slightly translucent. Spoon this into clean wide-mouthed jars. Seal, Use within three or four months.</p><p>                                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

Accompanied by a few stir fried vegetables: thinly sliced onion, courgettes, mange-tout peas, regular peas, peppers….anything rapid and easy to cook, this makes for a quick and interesting meal.</p><p>Ingredients: 1 dressed crab; a walnut-sized piece of peeled ginger, grated; a finely chopped clove of garlic; the white bit of a spring onion, finely chopped; a small segment of chilli, well chopped;  a dessertspoon of sherry; a dessertspoon of soy sauce; a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil;  a dessertspoon of vegetable oil.  For the omelet: one egg lightly beaten with a tablespoon of water and the finely chopped green part of the spring onion; salt and pepper; a tablespoon of vegetable oil. l</p><p>Method: First of all, cook the crabmeat filling. Heat up the oil in a smallish frying pan and throw in the ginger, garlic, spring onion white  and the chilli. Then add the meat from the crab, all of it. Stir, then add the sherry and soy sauce. When well mixed and hot, turn off the heat and add the sesame oil. Pile this onto a plate, and wipe out the frying pan, then place it back on the fire, and add the next spoonful of oil. Add the egg mix, and rapidly move the pan so that it fills the whole pan. Then turn off the heat, and allow the omelet to finish cooking, which should be very rapid indeed. Pile the crabmeat filling on top of it, roll the omelet around the crab mixture when serving, as though it was a filled crepe.  If you are making this for two, you will have to divide the egg mixture into two portions and repeat the frying, but as this takes very little time indeed, it shouldn’t be too onerous.</p><p>                                                                            -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>THE PRIZEWINNER</p><p></p><p></p><p>How did I get started in catering? </p><p>Many years more than I care to count, I won a big national cookery contest with a variation of the dish I’m going to show you this month. It was a layered dish of local sea food over a base of barely steamed samphire, destemmed, destalked. I still make it when samphire is around (it will be, soon-) but I have a new variation which you might be interested in trying when samphire is not available. It  copnsists of substituting lightly cooked sprouting broccoli, that is, chopping the stems into small segments, immersing them into a fair amount of boiling salted water, then removing them and chilling them rapidly by sunning them under a cold tap or dunking them into some very cold water, before draining well. This refreshes the broccoli and preserves their lovely emerald colour.</p><p>Since crabs and our delicious little brown or pink shrimp are once more readily available at Frary’s stall, all is ready for a lovely cold entrée or luncheon dish. It looks appetising in a glass bowl or little glass cups or ramekins.</p><p>Ingredients (for 3-4): 1-2 cups of shrimps (the rfeady peeled ones are dearer, but if you peel them yourself, the shells make an excellent base for fish soup or stock); 2-3 handfuls of ready cooked sprouting broccoli; 3 medium to large crabs, the brown meat and the white meat separated into different bowls; 1 teaspoon light soy sauce; 1 teaspoon sherry; 2 teaspoons of brown breadcrumbs; 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise; 1 lemon, halved; 1 heaping teaspoon of mild (Korma) curry paste; paprika, cayenne.</p><p>Method: First of all, layer the bottom of your bowl (or cups0 with the broccoli. Then mix the brown meat of the crab with the soy sauce, breadcrumbs and sherry.  Spoon this over the greens, gently flattening it out. Next, mix the white meat with the juice of half of the lemon and distribute this over the brown meat. </p><p>Now, stir the curry paste and the juice of the remaining half lemon into the mayonnaise and carefully cover the white meat. Last of all, sprinkle the shrimps with some paprika and a little cayenne and scatter them over the mayonnaise layer. </p><p>Voila!  A new version of my prizewinner!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                 -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>A LIFE IN THE KITCHEN</p><p></p><p>It was a grubby old building, half caff, half fish shop, just off Wells Quay. We gazed at it wistfully everytime we drove there from our home six miles away, in order to buy crabs, shrimp or fish directly from the fishing boats on the quay.  We could see the elegant Georgian features disguised by too many layers of garish paint.  All it needed was care and attention to transform it into our heart’s desire, a proper little restaurant serving the wonderful food immediately available, including the freshly caught seafood from the quay.</p><p>At that time, 25 years ago, Wells Quay brimmed with activity. Double parked coasters bearing grain and fertilizer, fishing boats, pleasure craft, dinghies, children diving off the tallest ships, swimming between the boats. Onshore, men unloaded the coasters, the fishing smacks, selling off  crab, shrimps,and the byproducts  of their trips: dabs, sole, brill, skate and various other fish. Mixing with the bystanders were port officials, tourists.  The seabirds were ever present: ducks, swans, nosy gulls. And beyond the harbour the beautiful salt marshes gleamed. A glorious spectacle!</p><p>We loved it and longed to open a restaurant near this hive of activity. We knew we could do it. Bernard, my husband, had grown up in the famous family hotel his parents ran in Burnham Overy Staithe. We’d worked there until the hotel was taken over (and ruined) by another, unfriendly branch of the family. We’d done other things since then, including raising a family of four. Now our children were old enough not to require constant attention and I could work full time. And, I could cook. I’d won several national prizes, ran a successful catering business and had worked part time as a chef in a local restaurant, open only during the summer.</p><p>Working in that seasonal restaurant, I’d begun to yearn for our own business. During my sessions, we filled the place simply by offering dishes containing only fresh, local ingredients. These proved more popular than the ‘safe’ options of steak, sausage or battered fish.</p><p>Nearly a quarter century ago, these notions seemed radical. We were cautioned, when first approaching a bank, not to reveal these menu plans. Indeed. Bank managers saw little advantage to buying and running a restaurant  situated by the sea. Folly indeed to surround oneself with 180 degrees of water, we were told. Nevertheless, we did it- and now things have changed. Most eating places pay lip service to local and seasonal ingredients nowadays.</p><p>So, this is why I offer here, as a couple of tasters, recipes containing the most local and seasonal of ingredients for this time: crab and asparagus.</p><p> </p><p>CRAB SLICES</p><p></p><p>When we first started the restaurant, crabs were served in only one way: dressed, that is, the flesh extracted then returned to the shell, then served with a simple salad and possibly a little mayonnaise. Coming from the States, with a dad who had been brought up in Baltimore, I knew of the rich American repertoire of crab dishes. These slices can either serve as sandwiches, or  finely cut into dainty slices, make the most appetizing seasonal nibbles.</p><p>It must be made the day before it’s required, in order for the ingredients to blend and the bread to become fully infused with the crabby flavours. And, one roll will serve several people, if it’s cut fairly thinly, Set out on a tray, tittivated with parsley, or in season, swags of samphire – or perhaps some Japanese seaweed such as Hijiki or Arame, soaked, drained and then scattered, this is an elegant ‘amuse guele’. The amount of heat from the chilli sauce can be varied to suite your taste, but don’t eliminate it altogether as chilli and crab compliment each other. </p><p></p><p>Use long soft rolls, the longer the better. A genuine French baguette is a bit too crusty; what English bakers call ‘French sticks’, long, soft and slightly woolly are ideal.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: for 1 long French stick: 2  dressed crabs; 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise; 2 teaspoons of soy sauce; 3-4 teaspoons of sweet chilli sauce (Thai or Malaysian type sauce);a handful of chopper parsley.</p><p></p><p>Method: Cut the bread lengthwise in half just enough to hollow it out. Dig out the inner crumbs, leaving it looking like a thick double dugout. Pulverize the crumbs, then empty the crabmeat, white and brown into a bowl, adding the breadcrumbs. Combine well, then add  the mayonnaise, soy and chilli sauces. And finally, the parsley. Fill up one of the ‘dugouts’ and  cover with the other half.  Slice the loaf in half and place them side by side on  a clingfilm lined tray. Cover with more  clingfilm and then weigh them down with another tray on top. Find a place in your fridge to chill and store these overnight, When you’re ready to serve them, cut them neatly and thinly, garnish with parsley, samphire or seaweed, and then serve.</p><p></p><p>ASPARAGUS</p><p></p><p>The big treat of high spring, asparagus is widely grown in North Norfolk. Places I’ve bought from include Wiveton, Rudham, Binham, Bricham, Sharrington. Personally I prefer it simple. With a potato peeler I usually shave off a little at the bottom of each stalk, then stand it upright in the tallest saucepan I possess. If there isn’t much asparagus, I make a rough collar of tinfoil to put round it in order to prop it up. Then I pour  boiling water on, enough to cover the bottom two or three inches, cover the saucepan, and boil for 7-10 minutes until it’s done to your taste. The top tips soften rapidly; some prefer their stalks more ‘done’ than others. Serve with melted butter’ hollandaise, or mayonnaise.  It’s wonderful served alongside hard boiled eggs, with either mayonnaise, green sauce or vinaigrette.</p><p></p><p>A word of warning: if you are prone to attacks of gout, eating too much asparagus too often can bring on the agony. As in all things, moderation is advised.</p><p></p><p></p><p>                                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

And nowadays, crab sandwiches have become popular, and even crab cakes are now available in many pubs and restaurants. But crab is also fine served up as part of a made up dish, such as noodle sheets layered with crabmeat and a cream sauce- a sort of crab lasagne, if you wish to put it that way. </p><p>I served this occasionally in our restaurant,years ago. Occasionally, if available, I peeled and thinly sliced puffball mushroom, substituting these sheets of fungi for sheets of pasta (I was secretly convinced that I was probably the only chef in the world serving this dish to the public – but – who knows?…). At any rate, a packet of lasagne sheet noodles and a couple of medium to largish dressed crabs are enough to make this delicious and homely pasta dish for four, so here goes!</p><p>Ingredients: One packet of Lasagne pasta; 2 dressed crabs; 1 tablespoon of sherry; 2 teaspoons of sweet chilli sauce; 3 teaspoons of fish sauce (Thai or Vietnamese sort);1 large tablespoon of flour; 50g butter; 550 ml milk; salt; pepper; nutmeg; cayenne; 100g of grated gruyere or emmental cheese.</p><p>Method: You need a smallish, deep dish, preferably rectangular or square for this.  And, it’s best to make this several hours in advance, leaving it to stand before baking, so that the pasta absorbs some of its liquid.</p><p>First of all, combine the crabmeat with the sherry, chilli sauce and fish sauce. Then make a cream sauce with the milk, flour and butter. Season this with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Now, butter your baking pan and ladle a very little sauce onto the bottom. Cover with a single layer of the pasta, then ladle a bit more sauce on top. Cover this with a thin layer of the crab mixture, then with the sauce. This time, sprinkle some of the grated cheese on the sauce. Now, more pasta, some crab, pasta, then the sauce. Finish with the cream sauce on top, together with the rest of the grated cheese. Dust it with a little cayenne, and leave it to stand (preferably in a fridge if the weather is not) for at least a couple of hours.  Leave it to stand for 15-20 minutes at room temperature before baking it in a medium oven for 35 minutes. Allow it to stand for 10 minutes before slicing into it. </p><p>This recipe can be varied by adding a little cooked white fish or some prawns or peeled shrimp to the crabmeat, along with a teaspoon or two of anchovy essence. And, for a really delicious addition, a savoury custard mixture of 200 ml milk and two or three egg yolks, well seasoned, can be poured over the whole dish (Moussaka-style), which will make the dish go further, besides providing a rich and sumptuous feast.</p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

They’re all easy to assemble, but when baking they must be watched as if they are overbaked, they are dry and tough. </p><p>Now, for a simple recipe for Butterscotch Brownies, These little treasures are a cook’s gift.

When we started out, I  tried several different recipes – I’m not a true ‘choco-holic’ and  most did not satisfy. I quickly discovered that unless the chocolate itself wasn’t dark, and of a high enough proportion (above 60%- but under75%) the result was disappointing. I finally worked out something which resembled a chocolate sort of pastry which I used to buy from  a little patisserie near Maubeuge-Mabillon when I studied in Paris. </p><p>It is basically two mousses, one set atop the other. The base is technically an omelette souffle, which rises and then sinks back. This forms the ‘crust’ with a richer topping of a mouse set with either real or ‘veggie’ gelatine – both work!  Not very much sugar goes into this pudding. This made it acceptable for many diabetics, and its absence of four made it ‘gluten-free’. But, it is very rich. Small servings are recommended. Make it in a large pizza or quiche dish with enough of an outer lip to contain it. It is made in two parts, the base is baked, and when that is cool the top is poured over it.</p><p>Total quantities required: 325g dark chocolate; 8 eggs; 75g sugar; 250ml double cream; 3 tablsp rum; 1 tsp vanilla essence; 1and1/2 teasp gelatine powder (the vegetarian version works well here); a little butter for greasing the dish; a little water.</p><p>For the base: Butter for greasing the dish; 125g chocolate; 4 eggs, the whites separated from the yolks; 75g sugar; 1 teasp vanilla.</p><p> Method: Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place it in a bowl with a tablespoon of water and melt it, either over simmering water, or in a microwave oven, removing it several times to stir it. When it is melted, stir in the egg yolks and the vanilla. Beat the egg whites until stiff, then gradually add the sugar. When this is all incorporated, fold the chocolate mixture into it and then pour this into the buttered baking dish. Bake it for 15-20 minutes in a medium oven until it isn’t liquid in the middle, but is just starting to colour more on the top. Remove from the oven, leaving it to cool, it will gradually sink while you prepare the topping.</p><p>For the topping: 1 and1/2 tsp gelatine powder; 200g dark chocolate; 4 eggs, whites separated from yolks; 3 tablsp rum.</p><p>Method: Dissolve the gelatine powder in a little bowl containing 2 tablesp water, and leave this to warm, very gently, either over a little simmering water or for a second or two in a microwave. You want this to just dissolve from powder into liquid. Chop and melt the remaining chocolate with another tablespoon of water and the rum. When the chocolate has just melted, stir in the gelatine, and then the egg yolks. Stir it well. Beat the egg whites until they stand in stiff peaks. Then whip the  cream.</p><p>Now, first fold the chocolate mixture into the cream. Last of all fold it all into then egg white mixture. Pour this onto the base, and leave it to stand an hour before refrigerating, for several hours before serving. </p><p>I know this does seem long, but it doesn’t take too much time if you have everything needed on hand.

    "content": "<html><body><p>FAVOURITE THINGS – FOOD IN THE LAST 50 YEARS</p><p></p><p>In March 1965 my husband Bernard and I came to live in Norfolk, in the coastal village of Burnham Overy Staithe. Bernard’s parents ran a large hotel, overlooking the creek and salt marshes. His dad, George was in poor health; the family needed help. Bernard had been born and brought up there.</p><p>The Moorings Hotel, a large building facing on to the creek, was made up of the original Georgian dwelling and its adjoining outbuildings and barns facing the water of the tidal creek, directly across from its small island, alongside a large swimming pool (originally part of a jetty), surrounded seawards by romantically empty sea marshes across the creek, it was a beautifully situated building. It  had been converted into a hotel in the early 1920s by Bernard’s grandparents. His grandfather had quarrelled with his brothers and had been bought out of his share of the family distillery in London. He and his wife and large family had come up to Burnham Overy for a holiday, renting a houseboat on Scolt Head Island. While on a day trip to Burnham Market they had spotted notices for an auction sale at the Hoste Arms of the Moorings buildings and outbuildings. It was then called Staithe House and Grandpa bought it sight unseen, compete with a sitting tenant.</p><p>The sitting tenant died and his daughter moved away to become an Anglican nun.  Grandpa decided to convert it into a hotel. He hired local builders, told them what he wanted and the new hotel opened a few years later, His requirements included a central heating system and wash-hand-basins in each room. It was roughly modelled on the model of a mini country house. No locks on bedroom doors and plenty of old-fashioned service, from polished shoes (left outside bedroom doors each night), early morning teas (in bed) and food for any dogs accompanying their owners. As well as the swimming pool, there were marshes to explore, the boat to Scolt Head Island, and a tennis court. Indoors, there were several lunges, a billiard room (doubling up as a well-stocked library) and, of course, meal after meal in a large dining room directly facing the water.</p><p>Meal after meal. From early morning tea to a large cooked breakfast. Then, elevenses (coffee, tea and biscuits). A hearty lunch. Tea in the afternoon then a full meal in the evening. If lunchtime was skipped, sandwiches would be prepared, with cake, etc.</p><p>The hotel opened at the beginning of March and closed at the beginning of November. During the winter break, there were a few occasions when the hotel re-opened for the Sailing Club banquet and the like, but winter was given over to family holidays, followed, in the new year, by extensive spring cleaning and the making of the hotel’s own marmalade. This marmalade was made by a long process in which the fruit was sliced and soaked for several days in mater – every receptacle in the establishment would be filled with the mixture of fruit and water and be left to stand….I still make it that way and its making takes up a lot of space.</p><p></p><p>Even though there was this winter gap of time when it was not open, The Moorings was successful from its beginning. It was mostly full. Indeed, the Board of Trade, which collected statistics from all hotels, informed the family that this was one of the most successful establishments of its sort throughout the UK, in spite of its truncated year. The hotel didn’t serve alcohol, even though guests were welcome to bring it along. This probably had to do with the licensing laws of the time. In the early 1960’s, the laws changed and the hotel acquired a license to serve drinks. Profits climbed. Indeed, it was this increase in profit which inspired the ultimate hostile takeover of the hotel, and its demise.</p><p>At first the hotel employed professional cooks. But Bernard’s grandpa loathed the food they produced and Bernard’s grandmother took over in the kitchen, producing the sort of simple and homely food which was warmly welcomed by the guests. Bernard’s father, George, helped her in the kitchen. He had been in the Merchant Navy but he was happy to come out of it when he and his young wife Muriel moved to Norfolk. But, when war was declared the hotel shut. George went in to the navy immediately.</p><p>During the war the village was a ‘no go’ area and the large building was requisitioned to house soldiers. Furniture was stored away in a few rooms and the hotel became the headquarters of various troops. Old Grandpa Phillips died in 1943 and Bernard’s granny moved to her daughter’s hotel in Surrey. My mother-in-law Muriel was left inhabiting the half-converted barn directly adjoining the hotel, with her young family while her husband George was in the navy, participating in a very, very active war, on convoys and destroyer in Italy and Africa. He finally ended up as a beach master during the D-Day landings and was just getting kitted up to ship off to the Far East when the war finally ended.</p><p>Muriel, originally from London, was more or less marooned in Overy Staithe. Across the road from the hotel was a large field of glebe land which had provided all the vegetables and most of the fruit and soft fruit for the hotel. She had to keep this garden going as best as she could; this included keeping bees, chickens and pigs. Some of the meat had to go to the government, but she was expected to provide her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, living near London, with some of the meat and veggies as well, dispatching them by post (via the railway in Burnham). Throughout the war George sent letters talking about planting seasons, gardening hints, horticultural suggestions….Bernard remembered helping her rub salt into the shoulders of pigs in order to make hams. It hurt.</p><p>When the war ended, old Mrs Phillips felt that she was too old to carry on. The building had been completely wrecked by our occupying troops and there was no compensation. \\so the hotel was put on the market. Ir failed to meet its £1000 reserve price. My father-in-law had returned from the war a weary and frail man. He decided that he would really like to join the river police. But, he was not tall enough. Someone recommended that he lie in bed for two weeks and with a bit of luck he would st retch that extra inch that he needed to qualify. Needless to say, this did not work. So, wearily he decided to restore the hotel, room by room, which he did, chiefly aided by Nelson Scoles, a local builder.</p><p>It reopened with just a few rooms in 1947, and gradually it was restored to its full size. Soon, it attracted the same sorts of clientele as before the war, and the same accolades it had previously qon. And, though there was rationing and many of the privations common to wartime and post war England, there was still that magnificent vegetable garden. There was local game. During the war the coastal waters had largely been out of bounds, so now, there plenty of fish and shellfish. Local beaches were gradually cleared of mines and once more, became accessible to the public. The hotel was able to revive its traditions of comfort and good food.</p><p>The hotel, like many of its sort, was a mini ‘Country House’;\\an early morning tea in one’s bedroom was followed by a lavish breakfast, local bacon and sausages, mushrooms, bloaters (from Wells) accompanied porridge or dried cereals. Toast from Hewitts Bakery in Wells, Orange juice or grapefruit halves, the latter served ready-carved.  Then, tea or coffee.</p><p>Elevenses consisted or tea or coffee, with plain biscuits. But, soon enough the big brass gong would sound and lunch would be served to the large dining room directly overlooking the creek. There was always soup – largely an invention of my father-in-law made up, often, of leftovers from the previous day, picturesquely entitled: ‘Norfolk Soup’, ‘Romany Soup’, ‘Game Broth’….whatever came to mind when asked by Muriel ask she typed out the menu to be Roneo’d .There were also first courses...in season, Globe Artichoke, with butter or vinaigrette; Asparagus on Toast with Melted Butter; both grown in the garden. Sometimes, exotic then, Spaghetti with Tomato and Bacon Sauce. Sometimes Dressed Crab was on the menu. These arrived boiled but not dressed and everyone working in the hotel assembled in the kitchen to prepare them. My sister-in-law remembers a few occasions when there were not enough people on hand and she did about 30 crabs on her own. These were simply served, dressed, put back in their shells, along with mayonnaise and a sliced quarter of lemon.</p><p>There were cooked meat main dishes, and on Fridays, always a cooked fish dish like slices of halibut with cheese sauce. And of course, there were always cold options – yesterday’s roasts swerved with salad. Meals always had cooked fresh vegetables alongside potatoes. Puddings were often stewed fruit served with ‘Shapes’ of semolina, tapioca, cornflour – or hot teamed puddings. Evening puddings were a bit more elaborate.</p><p>Tea was simple but traditional. Thinly sliced bread. Dainty sandwiches of cucumber, tomato or egg. Plain home made cakes: sponges, rock cakes and a few bought biscuits. </p><p></p><p>And then, in almost no time, the big gong would sound again for the evening meal. The food at that time was slightly fancier. Glorious fish: turbot or sole, sometimes lemon sole or dabs- often treated simply, simply floured and sauteed, swerved with a slice of parsley butter or Maitre d’Hotel butter. There were often partridges, pheasants, duck and guinea fowl as well as chicken, all served with inventive sauces and accompaniments.</p><p>Like most cooks, Bernard’s dad had his own likes and dislikes. He loved vegetables but cooked them longer than they do nowadays- but the freshness and quality of them still shone through. He did not like garlic, though he did grow a couple of rows of it for a couple of years after the war when the family housed a strange French lady who insisted on having it for her health. He made friends with some of the American families who were stationed at nearby Sculthorpe air base and was intrigued with some of their American dishes. His inventiveness came out in his soups and sauces. This was noticed in the earliest years of ‘The Good Food Guide’ for it was in the second edition that the Moorings appeared and continued to appear until our family left the hotel.</p><p>Most of the main ingredients were fully traceable in origin. Meat came from Barkers, the Burnham Market butcher. On Sundays, there was a huge roast of ribs of beef, roasted on the bone. Dad had been to a ‘carving school’  and was adept at serving out roasts, as was his eldest sister who had sold her hotel in Surrey and joined him in the kitchen during the later years of the hotel. She was a good baker and made meringues last thing at night in a slowly cooling electric oven which had been used during the main supper meal.</p><p>When the man who smoked bloaters in Wells retired, Bernard went to join him for a few days in order to learn how they were done. He and his dad converted an outdoors loo up in the garden into a smoke house, which they ysed. Otherwise fish came from Mr Farrow in Burnham, He delivered large turbot, brill, cod and halibut as well as sole and dabs.</p><p>Guinea fowl, partridges and pheasants came from Pettits of Reedham who were also hotl customers. Mrs Pettit made decorations from the feathers of their birds. Other produce was delivered by carious wholesalers, milk coming through the local dairy in Burnham, who also made and delivered a delicious cream cheese. Later on, I mixed this with various herbs, producing a sort of Hungarian style Liptauer cheese spread.</p><p>Ice cream, made by a prize-winning Cambridge dairy came by train; it was picked up in Hunstanton. My father-in-law also bought whole Stilton cheese, often choosing ones which had won prizes in various county shows (the Royal, the Royal Norfolk and the East of England shows). He read about them in the papers and telephones the makers. They were beautifully served in a splendid large Wedgwood Stilton dish, complete with a special knife. Other British cheese also were served.</p><p></p><p>Wholesalers, including purveyors of fancy stuff like anchovies or fancy tinned fruits, came to the hotel, as did the equivalent of a modern cash-and-carry wholesale firm. There were no supermarkets then. Indeed, when we returned to England after living in America, that super markets might be a good idea, he replied that they would never go down well in England, particularly in Norfolk!</p><p>When we came to the hotel in 1965, the hotel had only recently gained their liquor license. Bernard took over this, reading book after book about wines before they started their wine cellar in a part of the outbuilding in back of one of the garages. We bought most of our wines from Peatling and Cawdrons, storing some of them in their cellars in the shop in Wells, at the Globe.  Bernard and his dad also bought consigns of wine from some of the auction sales in London. They constructed asmall bar in one of the lounges that immediately led on o the dining room and I worked there before supper time, trying my best to serve occasional cocktails (hastily looking them up in a little booklet) as well as serving sherry and pre-dinner aperitif style wines.</p><p>We found  a house to live in on Friars Lane in Burnham Norton in the summer of 1966 and moved there on the day that England won the World Cup. Bernard cycled to work from our home and I stayed at home with out very young children. Occasionally I made a few American-style puddings for the hotel restaurant, but I was very busy indeed with the family and our large (one acre) garden. And it was then that me formation as a cook re-commenced.</p><p>What was available in local shops was limited. No garlic, Nor peppers or aubergines. No chillies, yogurt, skimmed milk, soured cream. No undyed smoked haddock. No fresh or frozen orange juice. Privations and the frugality of war had diminished and hardened the tastes of the general population, And, even in a climate which is able to produce fresh vegetables virtually all year round the availability of many of them was narrow. And, there were few native traditions for preserving. For instance,  there is no local version of pickling or preserving cabbages in order to make sauerkraut. </p><p>Here, I think that I must familiarize you with a bit of my own background. I was born and raised in the USA. My parents were both immigrants from Russia, with families who regarded food simply as fuel. Their diet were heavily plant based and designed to outlast hardship. Porridge and hot cereal in the morning. Plenty of hearty vegetable soup, summer and winter, cold and hot. Bread designed to last for longer than a week. Pickled, cured, smoked and dried meat or fish. Mushrooms, fresh or dried – all of these the mainstays of a Slavic diet.</p><p>Luckily, when we moved to Burnham, we had, four times a week, deliveries of old-fashioned good bread from Grooms. I could not abide the widely available fluffy, tasteless commercial bread found in many homes and shops.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I missed many of the mainstays of my New York American diet, particularly various fermented milk products. Why couldn’t I buy yogurt, or soured cream, or buttermilk? Then, during my first year of Living in Burnham Norton, I caught hepatitis. Because I could not digest fat, I wanted skimmed milk. Not available then, except in dried and powdered, imported from France, One early morning, on the radio, we heard farmers complaining  that they just could not sell enough milk.We wrote, suggesting that they try selling skimmed milk. There was a quick reply – there was no demand! When we asked about yogurt the answer was the same. We sent away for yogurt culture and began making our own…</p><p>The ethos behind the cuisine at the hotel was one of luxury. Standards were high, and well appreciated. The staff at the hotel enjoyed their own good meals, though thy insisted on having chips rather than potatoes cooked in any other way.  In our newly acquired house, I got to know our neighbours and grdually made friends with many local people. And I became familiar with their daily food habits. We all used a local  travelling butcher (from South Creake) who called once a week. When I asked him what he sold most of, he pointed to the stacks of trays in his little van, each containing ‘pig’s fry’ - a mixture of offal, liver, kidnes. This was often the sole fresh meat meal each week. This was often supplemented by tinned meat – Spam and Fray Bentos pies and some tinned fish, with occasional fish and chips which had its own van. Tinned fruit and some powdered ready-to-mix puddings were also popular. Pastries included sausage rolls and Norfolk Shortcakes, the latter a pastry made with lard, containing dots of more lard, dried fruit and sugar. Meals were accompanied with fruit squashes, Industrian sauces and jam was on hand, as well as that squidgy, fluffy bread. </p><p>Many families prepared a packed lunch for their children, although the school cooks prepared decent, tasty and nutritious meals for the children. \\the school cook’s sensible and tasty ways with vegetables (‘I just show the cabbage t the hot water’, she explained) were rejected. And, when my children had a birthday party and invited their classmates, I would receive heartfelt pleas to please provide sandwiches made with ‘shoppy’ bread and jam, with plenty of fruit squash as an accompaniment.</p><p>Nevertheless, many local families had members who were ardent wild fowler and pigeon, rabbit,and hare appeared on their tables.Of course, dubiously obtained pheasant, partridges and other game also appeared on their tables. Poaching then was a reasonable bread-winner, as local trains which accessed London could quickly whisk away their booty to London. Nowadays, with pheasants available at such low prices, this seems unimaginable. Then, the newspaper printed weekly reports of poachers up before the magistrate.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There were also those who gathered mussels, samphire and cockles. Over the years, there had been may disagreements between authorities administering the marshes and coasts over the gathering of these things. The uneasy balance between these parties still persist even though they all have vested interests in preserving this coastal area.</p><p>As the growing of vegetable crops became more industrialized, with picking and packing automated over the years, the farming population diminished. There were still gangs of fruit pickers, harvesting some soft fruit and on some farms, apples, pears, and asparagus. Some of the pickers were recruited from groups of travellers. Others were local housewives, and their gangmaster strutted around like cockerels….</p><p>The local diet was supplements with strong seasonings like mustard and horseradish. Mustard was grown locally and sold to Colmans of Norwich who dried and powdered it, selling it in small tins. Horseradish, a common and deep rooted ‘weed’ was grated before being combined with vinefar sugar and cream. There were a few horseradish ‘king’ who would bring their whole families to the coast to dig for horseradish during the winter months, Finely grated, and combined with vinegar, sugar and cream it was often available in small jars on stands along the roads between Lynn and Wisbech,  Parsley and mint were the most commonly used garden herbs. Saffron, which historically had been common in these parts, was largely unknown and has only recently been revived though the offices of Dr Sally Francis, a Burnham Norton girl. </p><p>It was not until the mid to late 70s that different products became available. Appearing occasionally were exotic vegetables – aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chillies. More fruit: mangoes and lychees. It is hard to imagine that salami and brie cheese were so exotic that it meant a drive to Norwich in order to obtain them. When the first Leftleys, a delicatessen, opened up on top of Wells High Street, it seemed a boon and delight to be able to buy these things locally.</p><p>The shallow waters of our coast had been a great source of fishing for locals. Traditionally, dabs (a sort of flounder) were caught in the shallow creeks by walking around in the water, bearing a long rake-like fork with sharp prongs at the ends, which stabbed and speared the fish as they swam in the shallows. Severely trimmed, then floured and fried, these were a popular local meal. Other fishing methods included laying out nets along the beaches, which brought in sea trout, salmon, bass and mullet. Local fishermen also netted mackerel, dogfish, and occasionally, brill and sole. Most of these fish, and their fishermen, have long disappeared, and local trawlers bring in crabs, lobster, shrimp, and if they go out far enough, whelks.</p><p></p><p></p><p>   </p><p> </p></body></html>"

It has  a few procedures which take a bit of time, though with a certain amount of planning it doesn’t really take that long, and can certainly be prepared well in advance. But, for a real crowd pleaser, this certainly takes pride of place.</p><p>Ingredients: (for 4)- 1 small amount of salmon fillet;smallish amounts of smoked haddock fillet; a small fillet of haddock, cod or other white fish;l a handful of cooked prawns; optional- more fish, mussels, clams, scallops,etc.; mushrooms, capers, and- optional- hard boiled eggs; peas, carrots. Potatoes- a good sized potato per serving; 3 tablespoons of cream; 600ml milk; 1 egg; butter; flour; 2 bay leaves; paprika; nutmeg; salt and pepper; Thai fish sauce; Marsala wine (or sweet sherry); breadcrumbs; optional – a little grated parmesan cheese.</p><p>Method: First of all, place the smoked haddock in a smallish shallow baking dish and cover it with 200 ml of the milk and a bay leaf, Place a sheet of foil on the dish and bake the fish in a moderate oven for 10 minutes, until the skin of the fish lifts easily off the carcass. Pour the milk into a smallish saucepan, discard the bay leaf and the skin of the fish and then cut it into bite sized pieces, placing them in a bowl. Wrap the salmon with the piece of foil, place it in the oven for 5 minutes, then remove whatever skin is on that fillet. Cut it into pieces, and add it to the bowl containing the haddock. Do the same for the white fish (cod or haddock) joining them up with the other pieces of fish. Then add the prawns- and any other bits of fish or shellfish. Slice and fry the mushrooms in a little butter, then add them to the mixture, along with a handful of capers. Cover the peeled, chopped potatoes with cold water, a teaspoon of salt, and the remaining bay leaf, bring to the boil and cook until the potatoes are really tender. While they are cooking, make a thick bechamel sauce with butter (2 tablespoons, flour 2 tablespoons, the milk from the smoked haddock and 400 ml of the remaining milk. This should be thick and unctuous. Season with the fish sauce, the Marsala and salt and pepper. Add the cream to this mixture. Allow this to cool, covering the cooking pot so that no skin is formed,</p><p>When the potatoes are coo0ked drain them and discard the bay leaf. Mash them well, then season with salt, pepper and plenty of grated nutmeg. Add the remaining milk (200 ml) and a little melted butter. Beat in the egg. They should be smooth and easy to spread. You may have to add a little milk here, depending upon the very nature of the potatoes themselves.</p><p>Now, butter a baking dish. Mix the cooled bechamel with the fish and place this at the bottom of your baking dish. If you wish to add hard boiled egg bits or peas, etc, now is the time. Smooth this quickly, then dollop on the mashed potatoes. Smooth these till they are level, and decorate with stripes formed with the times of a fork. Cover it with breadcrumbs, a few dots of butter, salt, pepper and paprika, and – if you wish- some grated parmesan cheese.</p><p>When you are ready, bake this in a moderate oven for at least 30 minutes. Allow it to stand for about 10 minutes before serving.</p><p>                                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p><p> </p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>GARDEN IN A BOWL</p><p></p><p>In one of Martin Cruz Smith’s excellent detective stories set in Russia, his melancholy hero Renko describes a vegetable plot near Chernobyl, in Ukraine. Despite the obvious danger from radiation, it is luxuriant, verdant, productive, with potatoes, beetroot, carrots, turnips, onions,etc—Russia on a plate, he concludes.</p><p>He refers, I think, to that great soup which almost might be eaten on a plate, Borscht. There are many, many different versions eaten thought the Slavic lands. Substantial ones with meat and bones, light and summery ones with just a few ingredients served mainly chilled, versions made with fermented beet juice starters, and the one that I give you now, a substantial all vegetable soup which was probably a mainstay of Lent or other fasting periods. This particular soup is fine served cold, but it is always comforting if there is a bit of wind and chill about. </p><p>The list of ingredients, sounding a bit like a vegetable grower’s catalogue, may seem a bit intimidating. Made with so many different vegetables the resulting taste is surprisingly complex and sophisticated. Its fine flavour, redolent of the productive allotment or plot, makes this one of my favourite recipes. It’s a comfort to the very ill and not ill at all alike.</p><p>I know that the quantity produced by making my version may seem awesome. But, the soup will last for longer than a week, will freeze well (use milk containers to store it) and is a really fine present for a friend. You may have to borrow or resurrect a large enough saucepan to contain it all. But it’s worth it!</p><p>Warning: there is an awful lot of cleaning, peeling and chopping required at the beginning. Sadly, there are no shortcuts, but apart from the prep, not much is required in terms of time, until the end, when you will need a stick blender, processor, or regular blender in order to amalgamate all the bits and produce the velvety, richly coloured  mixture which is wonderful, reheated gently and served with a\\ dollop of soured cream, Greek yogurt or crème fraiche. </p><p></p><p>Ingredients: a bunch of beetroot, complete with the leaves and stems. The roots must be peeled, the leaves and stems cleaned and chopped;a very large onion, chopped; 1 leek, chopped;1 large potato, peeled and chopped; 1 clove of garlic, chopped; a large carrot, peeled and chopped; a turnip, peeled and chopped ;2 blades of celery, chopped; a tin of tomatoes; optional- a few chopped mushrooms; a green or red pepper, chopped; 1 tablespoon of cooking oil; 1-2 tablespoons of butter; a cooking apple, peeled and chopped; 3 tablespoons of sugar; the juice of 1 lemon; 2 tablespoons of cider vinegar; parsley stalks (as many as you have); a small pinch of cumin; either a handful of fresh dill or a teaspoon of freeze-dried dill;1 tablespoon of vegetable stock powder; salt, pepper and cayenne.</p><p></p><p>Method: In a large saucepan, heat the butter and oil and saute the onion until it softens. Now add the chopped  beetroots, together with the garlic and potato. Cover the pan and cook it on a gentle heat for around 10 minutes, stirring at least once. Then add in the garlic, the chopped beetroot greens and stems, the carrot, turnip, celery, apple, tomatoes, and if available, the mushrooms and pepper, together with the pinch of cumin. Cover and cook for another 10 minutes. Then, add the parsley stalks, sugar, lemon juice, cider vinegar, dill and either vegetable stock or vegetable stock powder and enough water to cover the ingredients well. Cover the pot and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the toughest vegetable (the beetroot) is tender. Then remove the pot from the heat and allow it to cool slightly before pulverizing the mixture with either a stick blender or dolloping it into the processor. </p><p>Correct the seasoning, adding salt, pepper and cayenne, and if necessary, either sugar or cider vinegar (I particularly recommend the Whin Hill cider vinegar).

Now married to a Japanese woman who is a very fine cook, he enjoys almost every thing he obstinately rejected when a child. Now, influenced by her excellent cooking, the rest of our family has warmed to the Japanese condiments and seasoning she uses. That is why this column is a hymn to Miso, a common fermented soya product which is used to season soups, sauces, ordinary dishes. There are many sorts – and colours- of Miso. Many are available in delis and supermarkets in pricey little jars, but they can be found in oriental groceries as well as on specialist market stalls. White Miso – not really white, more of a greyish colour- has become my new best friend. Used first as an additional seasoning in leftover stir-fries, and to flavour vegetable water for soup, I’ve now branched out. A little bit, say, a heaping teaspoon full, added to about half a cup of mayonnaise (store-bought), with an additional teaspoon of sweet chilli sauce (the Thai type)  makes what I call ‘Grown Up Mayo’. Mixed well together with either a fork or whisked, and serve it with all manner of things: hard-boiled eggs, cold cooked veggies, potatoes, fish and chips….It is ultra delicious..

Outside of the busy months, we used to have occasional ‘special’ evenings, when we would not serve our regular dishes, but would concentrate on the food and wine of a specific area. This recipe found in a French paperback: La Cuisine de A a` Z: Sud-Ouest, Perigord, was an instant hit. Several customers requested that we put this on our regular menu, which we did, from then on.</p><p></p><p>Smoked haddock is as popular in France as it is here- it is called ‘Haddock’, as if there were no other sort. And, since the delicious smoked haddock from Cley Smokehouse is now regularly available in Wells, and fresh local tomatoes are at their most plentiful and luscious, this recipe seems appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients (for 2): 400g smoked haddock; 50ml milk; 50ml water; 1 largish onion, finely sliced; 120g ripe tomatoes; 1 small clove of garlic,minced; 80g olives, stoned and roughly chopped; 10g butter; 2 tablespoons of olive oil; a bay leaf; handful of parsley, chopped; a little fresh chopped marjoram or a good dash of dried oregano; salt, pepper and cayenne</p><p></p><p>Method: Put the milk and water into a saucepan large enough to contain the fish and bring it to the boil.</p><p>Place the fish fillets in it, lower the heat and gently poach the fish for 10-15 minutes, until the fish has changed colour and is easy to skin. This process can also be done in a microwave.</p><p>Meanwhile, peel the tomatoes by immersing them briefly in rapidly boiling water, then skinning them. Squeeze them gently to remove the seeds, then chop them very roughly. In the wintertime, you can use a very small tin of chopped tomatoes. </p><p>Saute the sliced onion in the little bit of butter gently, until it is a blondish, straw sort of colour. Then add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, parsley, marjoram or oregano, bay leaf, the pepper and cayenne. Cook for about 7-10 minutes; the sauce should have thickened.</p><p>Remove the fish from the liquid, skin it, remove any bones if present, then break it into smallish segments. Add the olives and olive oil, and mix it gently to combine.Finally, add the sauce to the fish-olive mixture, then taste for seasoning. This is one recipe where you don’t want to add salt too early on, as there is a fair amount of salt in the smoked fish as well as the olives. Reheat the mixture very gently before serving. It’s great with green beans of any sort as well as mash.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

Served hot, it is very fine, but it is also delectable cold, so that I usually prepare extra. But even if it is simple to prepare it does require an overnight marinade.</p><p>Ingredients (for two): 2 chicken pieces, or half a chicken; 1 lime; 1 clove of garlic, crushed; a half chilli, deseeded, deveined and very finely chopped; ½ teaspoon of dried oregano; salt and pepper; 1 teaspoon of tomato puree; a tablespoon of frozen peas; chopped parsley; a little cooking oil.</p><p>Method: Make the marinade by juicing the lime and mixing it with the garlic, chilli, dried oregano and some salt and pepper. Rub this well into the chicken pieces, and place them in a bowl to marinade overnight, turning them at least once. </p><p>Next day (or evening), remove the chicken pieces from the marinade, reserving it. Dry the chicken with a paper towel. Heat up a little cooking oil and fry the chicken pieces in the hot fat until they have coloured slightly. Then place them in an oven-proof casserole. Add the tomato puree and marinade to the hot oil, mix briefly, then pour this over the chicken. Cover and roast for 20-30 minutes, until the chicken is done. Then add the peas. Remove the casserole from the oven in order to allow the chicken to ‘rest’.

It  copnsists of substituting lightly cooked sprouting broccoli, that is, chopping the stems into small segments, immersing them into a fair amount of boiling salted water, then removing them and chilling them rapidly by sunning them under a cold tap or dunking them into some very cold water, before draining well.

Indeed, I was stopped several times on the street, to ask for the recipe, which is why it’s featured this month. Unlike most lemon puddings, except for the crust, it contains no cream or butter, thus sitting lightly on the tummy after a slap-up dinner.</p><p>The recipe comes from Peter Graham’s translation of Jacques Medecin’s ‘Cuisine Nicoise’, ‘The Cooking of Nice’. Medecin was mayor and noted for being fairly shady, but his recipes are wonderful.</p><p>I’ve altered the recipe slightly from the original. First of all, I prefer my own pastry to the one in the book. And also, I’ve doubled the quantity of sugar specified, from 20 grams to 40 grams. Not a lot in any case, and the tartness of the taste is in no way compromised.</p><p>Ingredients: For the pastry: 150g plain flour; 100g butter; pinch of salt; a little cold water. For the filling: 2 small or 1and ½ large lemons; 40g sugar; 4 eggs; 1 tsp cornflour.</p><p>Method: Crumble the butter into the flour and salt. Add enough water to make a dough. Shape this into a disc and wrap it in film. Chill for an hour. Roll it out on a floured surface and place in an 8 or 9 inch pie or tart tin. Prick it all over with a fork, line this with foil and place inside the foil either baking beans (I use the same dried broad beans I’ve had for 20 years) or ceramic ‘beans’. Bake in a hottish oven for 10 minutes. Then remove the foil(and beans), and bake for another 5-7 minutes, until the bottom of the tart looks as though it is dry. This is called ‘Blind Baked’ pastry.</p><p>For the filling: Separate the yolks and whites of eggs, placing the yolks in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Beat the yolks with half the sugar. Then grate in the rind of one of the lemons. Next, squeeze in the juice. Finally add the cornflour. Cook, stirring, over a very, very low heat until the mixture has just started to thicken and coat the spoon. Remove from the heat. Now, whisk the egg whites until they are stiff and then fold in the remaining 20 grams of sugar. Whisk a little bit longer, then combine the yolk and white mixtures by first stirring in a little bit of the yolk mixture into the whites, then folding in the rest swiftly afterwards. Place this in the crust and bake it for 15-20 minutes in a hottish (400’) oven. It should be golden brown, and fluffy. Don’t worry when it sinks a little after it has cooled; it is still light and ethereal and a delight to serve – with cream or without.</p><p>                                                                                -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>"

Rich and somewhat tricky because of the dough’s high butter and ground almond content, the ingredients are simple but a bit of patience is required in the rolling out.</p><p></p><p>Contents: For the pastry: 150g ground almonds; 150g plain flour; 150g butter; 110g caster sugar; 1 tsp salt; zest of 1 lemon; juice of ½ lemon; 2 egg yolks.  For the filling 200-300g raspberries and a small jar of raspberry jam or fresh stoned apricots (depends on size) and a small jar of apricot jam.</p><p>An 8inch or 20cm two-part tart pan.</p><p></p><p>Method: Mix the almonds, flour, salt, lemon zest and sugar together. Cut the butter into small segments and crumble it into the dry ingredients. Mix the egg yolks with the lemon juice and add a tablespoon of cold water to it .Add this and mix it into the flour- butter mixture, adding a very little water, if necessary. With floury hands form it into a ball, wrap it in either clingfilm or put it in a plastic bag and chill it well.</p><p>When you are ready to bake it, place a flat tray or pan into a medium oven to heat up. Roll out 2/3 or so of the dough onto a lightly floured sheet of cling film. It should be thin enough and large enough to form the base of the tart. Refrigerate the remaining dough. Reverse the dough rolled on the clingfilm into the tart tin, Cut off any bits flapping over the sides. If there are any gaps, just dab in a little more dough. Line this crust with a piece of aluminium foil and cover this with baking beans. Place this on the already hot tray in the oven and bake it for 10 minutes. Then, remove the foil and beans and return the crust to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes. </p><p>Meanwhile line another tray or baking sheet with clingfilm. Roll out the remaining dough onto it, shaping it into a rectangle. Refrigerate this until you are ready to assemble to tart.</p><p>To assemble the tart, spoon enough raspberry jam on the bottom of the tart shell to cover it well. Then tip in your raspberries (the more, the merrier, I think!).  In the winter you can use frozen raspberries. Cover this fruit with a generous coating of the raspberry  jam. </p><p>Remove the tray of rolled out pastry dough and cut out strips of the pastry. Form this into a lattice-  the chilled dough strips are easier to manipulate than the pastry at room temperature.</p><p>Bake the tart for 15-20 minutes, until the strips of pastry are starting to colour.</p><p>For apricots, follow much the same procedure, with the bottom coated with jam, then the fresh fruit, arranged, and then the jam spooned over,</p><p>Leftover dough, then rolled out and re-used as jam cookies. Roll it out a little more thickly than if it were intended for a tart. Stamp it into rounds with a cookie cutter, depress the center of each circle and dab it with a bit of jam. Bake fir 10-12 minutes, until light golden brown then cool on a wire rack.</p><p></p><p>                                                                    -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

And sometimes, it’s necessary to produce something bite-sized which will either serve as an hors d’oeuvre or a light meal.</p><p>These little pastries are something I’ve made for years. They are cook-friendly, can be made  ahead of time, then rewarmed for ten minutes in a low oven. They can also be pre-prepared , left in the fridge then baked for twenty minutes in a very hot oven.</p><p>Originally, I rolled out puff pastry  thinly then stamped circles which I  filled and fashioned into half moons. Nowadays, I roll out the pastry thinly into a good-sized square and cut it into 3 inch (7cm) squares, then turn  into filled triangles. Much less work! </p><p>Ingredients: 1 packet of puff pastry. If you can get the sort that is made with butter, it’s nicer, otherwise the ordinary one will do.;3 large or 4 small eggs; 2 tablespoons of cream; a tablespoon of butter; salt and pepper; 2 or 3 slices of smoked salmon.</p><p>Method: Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk lightly. With a tablespoon, extract a tablespoon of the beaten egg and place in a small bowl  with the same amount of milk or water. This will be enough for sealing and glazing the pastries.</p><p>Heat the butter in a saucepan or small frying pan. Add the eggs and cream, stirring gently till it is a thick creamy curd. Immediately pace this in a cold bowl to prevent further cooking and add chopped snippets of the smoked salmon. Stir to blend.</p><p>On a lightly floured surface roll out the puff pastry as thin as you dare. Cut into squares. Brush the edges of these squares lightly with  egg wash. Place teaspoons of the filling in one corner of each square, then fold over to form triangles. Press with a fork to seal. Place the triangles on a Bakewell- paper lined pastry sheet. Brush the tops with the egg wash.</p><p>Now, chill them until 20 minutes before you are ready to bake them in a very hot oven, prior to serving. They should be a warm golden brown. They can rest in a gently warm oven, or, as said before, gently reheated .</p></body></html>"

Most are wonderful simply cooked ‘as is’, steamed or boiled in a little water, salted or not as you prefer.</p><p>Now, if you have some extra cooked vegetables: peas, new potatoes, turnips, carrots, broad or green beans,  and later in the season, corn on the cob, let me recommend an authentic ‘Macedoine’ or ‘Russian Salad’.</p><p>Not that gloopy stuff out of tins which used to be a feature of public catering when I first hit England in the very early 1960s. No! What I’m suggesting is that you cut up your cooked potatoes, turnips, carrots into smallish pieces, to be mixed with your peas and chopped beans. If your broad beans are humungus</p><p>Peel them by crushing the skin lightly between your forefinger and thumb. Mix them all gently together and then dress them with mayonnaise (shop bought is fine) to which you add a good teaspoonful of Dijon mustard and a significant splash of lemon juice.</p><p>Unless you’ve got some yellow beetroot available, don’t add the red stuff; the taste dominates and it leaches red into the rest of the salad. And don’t include cooked legumes such as kidney, chickpea, lentils or butter beans. Their granular texture totally obliterates the delicacy of the new spring veggies.</p><p>However, a small quantity of cooked mushrooms won’t harm the mixture. Do add chopped parsley and a little finely minced tarragon if you have any.</p><p>Dollop this salad onto some nice young lettuce leaves and either serve as is, for a lovely starter, or with a hard boiled egg or two as a more than satisfactory lunch.</p><p>Later in the season, you can hollow out a halved tomato, then scoop out its middle and seeds. Salt the interior slightly and leave it to drain for ten minutes. Then pile the Macedoine into the tomato halves and serve with dressed crab, a little leftover cooked fish or some other shellfish. This is quite an elegant cold meal.</p><p>                                                                                        -Carla Phillips0</p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>MADEIRAN ROLLS</p><p></p><p>In Madeira, they bulk up their bread dough with sweet potato.  This is because, though they are pretty well self sufficient in wheat – there isn’t quite enough, and they have had to supplement their baking doughs with a more plentiful carbohydrate. This dough, slightly sweetened, naturally, by the higher quantities of natural sugars, makes for particularly tasty rolls, which are served everywhere on the island. Heated, split in the middle and buttered with garlic and parsley butter, they appear frequently  with poultry or fish.</p><p>I have searched out recipes- and have finally settled on a combination of various ones- compiled from a badly translated cookbook, the net, and the words of  the proprietor of an open air stall near Funchal Town Market. Easy to make, filled with all sorts of nutritional goodies from the sweet potato content, they have become quite a hit in my household. They freeze beautifully, so I make a large batch which  lasts well.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 large or 2 medium sweet potatoes; approximately 600g strong flour; 2 packets of yeast; a pinch of sugar; 12 grams of salt (2 teaspoons); 200ml warm water; 1 tablespoon of salad oil.</p><p></p><p>Method:  Bake the sweet potato(es) in a hottish oven for 50 minutes to an hour, until quite soft to the touch. Then, when cooled off enough to handle, peel  and mash the flesh. Weigh it up in a large-ish bowl, then add enough flour to total 900grams in weight. </p><p>Now, remove 3 large tablespoons of the flour, and combine it with the warm water, a pinch of sugar and the yeast. Mix well and leave, covered, for 30 minutes in a warmish place.</p><p>Now, add the salt to the remaining flour-potato mixture, and combine it with the slightly bubbly ‘sponge’, together with the tablespoon of oil. Combine it all – you may need to add some extra water (the proportions and quality of flour and sweet potato determines this), Knead it well for 5 to 8 minutes. Then place the dough in the large bowl , cover it and allow it to rise for 2 hours.</p><p>When you remove the risen dough from the bowl,it will deflate. With your hands, stretch and roll the dough into a long ‘sausage’ and cut this into 2 ½ -3 cm chunks. Place them on trays lined with baking paper. You should have between 28 and 20 rolls. Leave theswe to rise in a warmish place, then bake in a hot oven for 15-20 minutes until lightly brown on top.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

They may lack the waxy firmness and sweet taste of late spring wonderspuds, but they more than compensate with their delightfully crumbly, collapsing structure and earthy undertones of taste.</p><p>Of course they are splendid when baked. Straight out of the oven, bashed slightly (in order set their collapse in motion), split and served with butter, salt and black pepper. Or, if you like it, served with only a little butter, then some Greek-style yogurt, minced chives or spring onions, then salt and pepper. Bliss.</p><p>Or, you can hollow out the baked potato, scooping the ‘meat’ out of the delicate shell. Mash this potato well, season with salt and pepper, then grate a little onion into it. Next, mix in  some grated cheddar, a little butter and a small dollop of mustard. </p><p>How much, I can hear you asking? As much as you fancy. Taste and try it. Then, pile it back into the skin-shell and grate a tiny amount more cheese on top of it. Return it to the oven—either a hot oven for about 15 minutes, or a low oven for about 25 minutes.</p><p> The other maincrop potato treat I thought I’d mention in this piece is a method of using leftover mashed potatoes. This is popular with family and friends and is an ideal easy supper or snack. Again, I’m not going to be precise about weights and measures as, in the case of leftovers, this is always variable.</p><p>If you have more than a teacupful of mash, place it in a bowl. Grate a little fresh onion into the spuds. Or, if you have some, substitute some finely chopped spring onions. Stir this into the potatoes. Break an egg into this mixture and stir well. Then stir in enough plain flour to make this mixture malleable, firm, easy to handle. Season this mixture to taste. </p><p>Finely slice some hard cheese: gruyere, Jaarlsberg, Mrs Temple’s mountain cheese, cheddar, White Stilton- whatever you like and have on hand. You want a few little slivers, roughly the size and shape of £2 coins (maybe a bit bigger).</p><p>Make little potato cakes by surrounding each little cheese sliver with mash. Roll each potato cake in breadcrumbs (dry commercial ones will do). Fry these little cakes in hot oil until golden brown. If you haven’t had these before, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. Variations I’ve tried include covering the little sliver of cheese with chopper anchovy or black olive puree. These are fine, but the added sophistication is not strictly necessary.</p></body></html>"

Each customer in front of me also bought brown and white slices of some sort of rolled pastry, so when it was my turn, I automatically pointed at them and said ‘Dos!’. This is a well-appreciated version of what I call ‘Minorcan Roll.’ </p><p></p><p>Ingredients: For the Caramel Syrup: 200g granulated sugar; 250ml water.

In a heavy bottomed saucepan, melt the sugar with a splash of the water, without stirring, until it starts to bubble and brown. Then you can swirl it occasionally, so that any cliffs of sugar on the edge of the saucepan break up into the body of the molten mixture. When it is a good rusty brown, remove from the fire, and pour in the rest of the water, standing well back as it will hiss and spit threateningly. Now return it to the fire and stir until the mixture is dissolved. This won’t take very long. Remove from the heat and leave this to cool.

Melt the butter, and set aside. </p><p>Whip the egg whites until stiff. Then gradually add the caster sugar, meringue fashion. Don’t bother to wash out the egg beaters, and use them to beat the egg yolks until light. Add the butter and the vanilla.</p><p>Fold these into the egg white-sugar mixture rapidly. </p><p>Now sift the flour-salt mixture onto the mix, and fold them in. Spoon this mixture into the baking tin, and bake for 10-12 minutes, until  dark golden brown on top. Remove this from the oven, and roll it up in its paper, allowing it to cool.</p><p></p><p>While the cake is baking, whip the cream until stiff and leave in the fridge.</p><p>When the cake has cooled, unroll it carefully, and saturate it in the caramel syrup., pouring it on to both sides. Do this as rapidly as possible so that it doesn’t break up. Fill it with 2/3 of the cream and roll it up, then, with a spatula, cover the top and sides with the rest of the cream.

Here are two which hit my spot.</p><p></p><p>AUBERGINE PUREE</p><p></p><p>This is a version of an Israeli variation of this ubiquitous dip, good with thinly sliced toast, sourdough bread, or even some raw vegetables.</p><p>Ingredients: (serves 4-6)- 1 aubergine, approx 270-280g; 1 small clove of garlic; 2 tsp lemon juice; a small pinch of cumin; a pinch of cayenne; a pinch of salt; 1 good sized tablespoon of mayonnaise; 1 tblsp olive oil.</p><p></p><p>Method: Pierce the aubergine with a sharp knife in several places and roast it in a hot oven for 40 minutes, until it’s thoroughly floppy. Leave it to cool in a colander; it will ooze. Then, scrape the flesh away from the skin (which you discard). Place the flesh into a smallish mixing bowl, then add the cumin, salt, cayenne, garlic and lemon juice. Beat these well (a plunger mixer will do well). Then add the mayonnaise, and finally dribble in the olive oil.  This puree will last for 10 days to a fortnight. </p><p></p><p>LITTLE ONION SANDWICHES</p><p></p><p>Before you react with total misbelief, consider that these sandwiches were once the welcome staple treats of American ladies lunches, back in the 1950’s. And very welcome they were. If you follow all the steps carefully, and they are easy ones, you will see why.</p><p>Ingredients: 1 loaf of sliced white bread. Get the best you can; 1 large bunch of parsley, finely chopped; 1 very large Spanish (sweet) onion, thinly sliced into very fine rounds; Mayonnaise (Hellmans. Etc are fine); salt and pepper</p><p></p><p>Method: The night before you need these, immerse your finely sliced onions in cold water, and leave them to soak for several hours, draining, then changing the water at least once before the next morning. Then, soak the onions for an hour or two but this time in salted water. Now, drain well. </p><p>Now, spread the sliced bread thinly with mayonnaise. Scatter the onion slices on half of these slices and make them into sandwiches. Trim the crusts from the bread. Place the chopped parsley onto a tray or shallow dish. Then cut the sandwiches into dainty-ish triangles. With a spatula spread a thin coating of the mayo onto the sides of these triangles and dip or roll these in the chopped parsley. After this, place them onto a serving dish or tray. They can be covered with cling film and set aside for several hours.  </p><p>Once they have been tried, you’ll be astonished at how rapidly these little things will disappear.</p><p></p><p>Carla Phillips</p><p>16 High Street</p><p>Wells-next-the-Sea</p><p>Norfolk NR23 1EP</p><p>Telephone 01328-710852</p></body></html>"

Through the years I’ve altered and added to the original, and this version is truly formidable. When I cannot obtain pumpkin or winter squash, I substitute butternut squash. I incorporated the original garnish for the soup into the body of the recipe as well as adding some spice.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 tblsp olive oil; 1 tblsp butter; 250g onions, chopped; 250g carrots, chopped; 250g parsnips, chopped; 250g pumpkin or squash, chopped;  1 clove of garlic; chopped; 1 tsp ground cumin; 1 tsp ground coriander; 1 tsp ground turmeric; 1 litre of vegetable stock; salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne; a handful of fresh coriander; a handful of parsley; juice of a lemon; a pinch of paprika.</p><p></p><p>Method: In a large, hot saucepan, melt the butter and oil together, then tip in the onions. Mix them well, lower the heat and leave them to cook, covered  for about 5 minutes. Next, add the carrots and parsnips, stirring them well. Cover the pan and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Now add the squash and garlic, cooking them for another 5 minutes. Add in the spices, stir for a minutes, then finally add the vegetable stock. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are soft. Now, remove from the heat  and add in the herbs, seasoning and lemon juice.  Zap the mixture with a stick blender pr puree it in a blender or processor. Correct the seasoning and add the paprika. If it seems too thick, add a little water.</p><p>The texture, colour and robust flavour of this soup should cheer you up during these dark December days.</p><p>                                                                   </p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>MOUCLADE</p><p></p><p>I discovered this dish during my restaurant days. A customer who’d enjoyed this on a trip to Southwest France told me about it. Mussels in a rich creamy yellow sauce and ‘ Please could we do this on Saturday night?’</p><p>Out came the recipe books and various versions were tried and rejected. The dish originated from one of the French Atlantic ports and used curry in the French manner, that is very mildly. It originally called for white wine but we found that the local dry cider worked perfectly, and can be used relatively lavishly. As our very fine local mussels are now available, and once you’ve had your first or second ‘hits’ of Moules Mariniere, here’s a very fine way of preparing them. Most of the work can be done in advance, so it is a useful dish for entertaining.</p><p>Ingredients: (for 2) a litre or 2 pints of mussels; 2-3 celery stalks; 3-4 shallots; ½ litre dry cider; 3 egg yolks; 1and1/2 level teaspoons of mild curry powder; 150mlo (small container) double cream; a walnut sized knob of butter</p><p>Method: Scrub and de-beard the mussels. Place them in a saucepan with half the cider, the chopped shallots and celery . Cover, bring to the boil and when the mussels have opened (3-4 minutes), remove them and shell them, saving all the liquid. Return the liquid to the heat, boiling it fiercely to reduce by a half.</p><p>In a separate heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the curry powder, egg yolks and the cream mixing it well. Then strain in the hot mussel and cider liquid, stirring it constantly over a fairly low heat until it just starts to coat a spoon. Then remove from the heat and stir in the butter.</p><p>When you’re ready to serve it, heat the remaining cider. When it just comes to the boil, add the mussels to the hot liquid to reheat them. This should not take more than a minute or two. Place them in a warmed shallow baking dish or plate, spoon the sauce over them, then place the dish under a grill or in a very hot oven, very briefly, to reheat until the edges just start to bubble. To accompany this, as a main dish, serve plain rice, and lots of brightly coloured , simply prepared vegetables: broccoli, carrots, beans,etc.</p><p></p><p>                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

The sauce is also a fine accompaniment to plainly cooked fish, meat, or even hard boiled eggs.  The sauce, ‘Salsa Verde’ (Italian) or ‘Sauce Verte’ (French) is easily made ahead of time. When served with mussels, you open them ahead of time in a glass of cider, to which you’ve added a little chopped onion and celery. When you’ve opened the mussesls, remove them from the liquid, discarding their shells. Strain the liquid into a wide saucepan. </p><p>Before serving, when all the other elements of your meal are ready, heat this liquid and immerse the mussels in it for a couple of minutes. Then drain and strain the mussels with the following sauce.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 shallot; 2 cloves of garlic; 4 anchovies; a large handful of parsley; a large handful of basil; 2 teaspoons of capers; 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar; pepper; a little cayenne; 100 ml of olive oil.</p><p>Method: Chop finely, or process together the shallot, garlic, anchovies, parsley; basil, capers and wine vinegar.

    "fileName": "MY FAVOURITE THINGS.html",
    "content": "<html><body><p>MY FAVOURITE THINGS – FIFTY YEARS OF CHANGING MENUS</p><p></p><p>In March 1965, My husband Bernard and I came to Norfolk, to the coastal village of Burnham Overy Staithe. Bernard’s family ran a large hotel overlooking the creek and salt marshes. His dad, George, was in poor health, the family needed help. Bernard had been born and brought up there.</p><p></p><p>The Moorings Hotel, a large building fronting the creek, was made up of the original Georgian dwelling and its adjoining outbuildings and barns. Facing the water, directly across from its small island, alongside a large swimming pool which was fed and emptied by a tidal sluice, surrounded, seawards, by dramatically empty sea marshes across the creek, it was a very beautifully situated building.</p><p></p><p>It had been converted into a hotel in the 1920s by Bernard’s grandparents. His grandfather had quarrelled with his brothers and had been bought out of his share of the family distillery in London. He and his wife and children had come up to Burnham Overy for a holiday, renting a houseboat on Scolt Head Island. While on a day trip to Burnham Market they had spotted the notices for an auction sale at the Hoste Arms of the Moorings buildings and outbuildings. It was then called Staithe House and Grandpa bought it sight unseen, complete with a sitting tenant.</p><p></p><p>The sitting tenant died  and his daughter moved away to become an Anglican nun. Grandpa decided to convert it into a hotel. He hired local builders, told them what he wanted, and the new hotel opened later in the ‘20’s. His requirements included a central heating system and wash-hand-basins in each room, and it was roughly modelled on a model of a mini ‘Country House’. No locks on bedroom doors and plenty of old-fashioned service, from polished shoes, which would be left outside the bedroom doors, early morning teas (in bed), to food for accompanying dogs. As well as the swimming pool and a tennis court, there were marshes to explore, and of course, the boat to Scolt Head. Indoors, there were several lounges, a billiards room (doubling as a well stocked library – and of course, meal after meal.</p><p></p><p>Meal after meal. From early morning tea to a big breakfast. Then elevenses (coffee, tea and biscuits). A hearty lunch. Tea in the afternoon then a full meal in the evening. If lunchtime was skipped. Sandwiches would be prepared, with cake, etc. How did they manage to eat it all?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The hotel opened at the beginning of March and closed at the beginning of November. During the winter time, there were a few occasions when the hotel re-opened, for the Sailing Club banquet and the like, but winter was given over to family holidays, followed, in the New Year, by extensive spring cleaning and the making of the hotel’s own marmalade. This marmalade was made by a long process in which the fruit was sliced and soaked for several days in water; every receptacle in the establishment would be filled with a mixture of fruit and water and be left to stand...I still make it that way.</p><p></p><p>Even though there was this winter gap of time when it was not open, The Moorings was successful from its beginnings. It was mostly full, Indeed, the Board of Trade, which collected statistics from all hotels, informed the family that this was one of the most successful establishments of its sort throughout the UK, in spite of its truncated year. The hotel didn’t serve alcohol, even though guests were welcome to bring it along. This probably had to do with the licensing laws of the time. In the early 1960’s when the laws changed, the hotel acquired a license to serve drinks. Profits climbed, Indeed, it was this increase in profit which inspired the ultimate hostile takeover of the hotel and its demise.</p><p></p><p>At first the hotel employed professional cooks. But, Bernard’s Grandpa loathed the food they produced and Bernard’s Grandma took over in the kitchen, producing the sort of simple and homely food which was warmly welcomed by the guests. Bernard’s father, George, helped her in the kitchen. He had been in the Merchant Navy but he was happy to come out of it, and he and his young wife Muriel moved to Norfolk. But when the war came along, the hotel shut. George went into the navy immediately.</p><p></p><p>The village was a ‘no go’ area and the large building was requisitioned to house troops. Furniture was packed away into a few rooms and it became the headquarters of various soldiers. Old Mr Phillips died in 1943 and Bernard’s Grandma moved to her eldest daughter’s hotel in Surrey. My mother-in-law Muriel was living in a half-converted barn directly adjoining the hotel, with her young family while her husband, George, was in the navy, participating in a very, very active war – on convoys, destroyers – in Italy and Africa, he finally ended up as a beach master during the D-Day landings, and was just getting kitted up to ship off to the Fqr East, when the war finally ended.</p><p></p><p>My mother-in-law, originally from London, was more or less marooned in Overy Staithe. Across </p><p></p><p></p><p>the road from the hotel was a large field of glebe land which had been rented by the hotel. It provided all the vegetables and most of the fruit for the hotel. She had to keep this garden as best as she could, and this included keeping a couple of pigs, plus chickens. Some of the meat had to go back to the government, but she was also expected to provide her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law with some of the meat and veggies as well, dispatching them by post (via the railway in Burnham). Throughout the war, George sent her letters talking about planting seasons, gardening hints, horticultural suggestions. Bernard remembered helping her rub salt into shoulders of pig in order to make ham...a painful task.</p><p></p><p>When the war ended, Old Mrs Phillips didn’t want to return, feeling that she was too old to carry on. The building had been completely wrecked by the occupying troops and there was no compensation. So, it was put on the market but failed to meet its £1000 reserve price.  George, my father-in-law, had returned from war a weary and frail man. He decided that he would really like to join the river police. But, he was not tall enough to qualify. Someone recommended that he lie in bed for two weeks, and with a bit of luck he would stretch just that extra inch that he needed to qualify. Needless to say, this did not work. So, wearily,  he decided to restore the hotel, room by room, which he did over a few years, chiefly aided by a local builder, Nelson Scoles.</p><p></p><p>It reopened with just a few rooms, in 1947 and gradually was restored. And, it soon attracted the same sorts of clientele as before the war, and the same accolades it had previously won. Although there was rationing and  many of the privations common to war and post war England, there was still that magnificent vegetable garden. There was local game. Because the coastal waters had largely been out of bounds, there were plenty of fish and shellfish. Local beaches were gradually cleared of their mines, becoming once more accessible to the public. Once more, the hotel could revive its tradition of good food.</p><p></p><p>The hotel, like many of its kind, was a mini ‘Country House’. Early morning tea in one’s bedroom was followed by a lavish breakfast. Local bacon and sausages, mushroom, as well as bloaters from Wells, accompanied porridge or dried cereals. Toast from bread baked at Hewitt’s Bakery in Wells. Coffee and tea. Orange juice or grapefruit, the latter served looking intact, but really carved out of the carcass..</p><p></p><p>Elevenses consisted of tea or coffee, served with a simple bought biscuit. But, soon enough, the</p><p></p><p></p><p>brass gong would sound and lunch would be served in the large dining room directly overlooking the creek. There would be soup, usually an  invention of my father-in-law, made up of leftovers from the previous day, picturesquely entitled - ‘Norfolk Soup’, Romany Soup’, ‘Game Broth’ .. whatever came to his mind while Muriel typed up the daily menu for the Roneograph printer. There were also cold first course. In season, Globe Artichokes, with vinaigrette, Asparagus on Toast, with melted butter, both grown in the garden – or quite exotic, then, Spaghetti with Tomato and Bacon sauce. Sometimes Dressed Crab was on the menu. The crabs arrived boiled, but not dressed and everyone working in the hotel assembled in the kitchen around the enormous table in the middle in order to prepare them. My sister-in-law Mary remembers a few occasions when there were not enough people in hand and she did 30 crabs all on her own.</p><p></p><p>These were simply served, dressed and back in their shells, with mayonnaise and a quarter of lemon. There were also cooked meat dishes, and on Fridays a cooked fish dish like sliced halibut with cheese sauce. And, of course, there was always a cold option: yesterday’s roast served with salad. There were also cooked vegetables, served alongside the potatoes.  Puddings were often cooked ‘shapes’: semolina, tapioca, corn flour, served with stewed fruit or jam, or steamed suet sponges.</p><p></p><p>Tea was traditional but simple. Thinly sliced bread, cut into dainty sandwiches filled with cucumber, tomato or egg. Plain cakes, simple sponges or rock cakes and a few bought biscuits, and then there was a good break before the gong sounded around seven and supper was served. The food then was slightly fancier. Glorious fish: sometimes turbot, brill or sole, simply floured and then sauteed, served with a bit of flavoured butter (Maitre d’Hotel), followed by roasted partridges or pheasants, served with George’s inventive sauces, or chicken portions,  baked or roasted with, again, inventive sauces and accompaniments. </p><p></p><p>Like most cooks, George had his own likes and dislikes. He loved vegetables but cooked them longer than they do nowadays – but the quality and freshness of them still shone through. He did not like garlic, though he did grow a couple of rows of it for a couple of years after the war, when the family housed a strange French lady who insisted on eating it raw for her health.  His inventiveness really came out in his soups and sauces. And, his cooking skills were noticed in the early days of ‘The Good Food Guide’. It was in the second edition of that book that The Moorings appeared, continuing to feature until our family left.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Most of the main ingredients were fully traceable in origin. The meat came from Barkers, the Burnham Market butcher. Sundays, there were huge ribs of beef on the bone. George had been to a ‘carving school’ and was adept at handling the roasts, as was his eldest sister, Mary, who had sold her hotel in Surrey and joined him in the kitchen during the later years of the hotel. Mary was a good baker, and made meringues last thing at night, in a cooling electric oven which had been used during the main supper meal.</p><p></p><p>When the man smoking bloaters in Wells retired, Bernard went there for a couple of days in order to learn how they were done. He and his dad converted an outdoors loo up the garden, not far from the beehives, into a little smokehouse. Otherwise, fish came from Mr Farrow in Burnham: large turbot, cod and halibut. Large bowls filled with dabs or lemon soles.</p><p></p><p>Guinea fowl, partridges and pheasants came from Pettits of Reedham, who were also customers. Mrs Pettit made decorations from the feathers of their birds. Other fresh produce was delivered by wholesalers – milk coming from the local dairy in Burnham, who also delivered a rich and delicious cream cheese. Later on I mixed it with various fresh herbs, making a sort of Hungarian type of Liptauer cheese to be served along with the other cheeses, George would buy whole Stilton cheeses, often choosing one which had won prizes in various county shows (the Royal, the Royal Norfolk, and the East of England), He read about them in the EDP, then telephoned their makers. They were duly served in the large Victorian Stilton cheese dish, complete with its special knife, alongside other British cheeses.</p><p></p><p>Ice cream, made by a prize-winning Cambridge dairy, came by train and was picked up in Hunstanton. Wholesalers, including purveyors of fancy stuff like anchovies or special tinned fruits, came directly to the hotel as did the equivalent of a large cash-and-carry shop. There were no supermarkets then. Indeed when we suggested to Tim Aldiss, who owned a local department store, that a supermarket might be a very good idea, he replied that it would never go down well in England, particularly in Norfolk!</p><p></p><p>When we arrived in England, the hotel had only recently gained a liquor license. Bernard took over this. He read book after book about wine before starting a wine cellar using part of an outbuilding near the garages. He bought most of the wine from Peatling and Cawdron’s wine shop situated at the Globe in Wells. Some of those wines were stored for us in their vaulted cellar. Bernard and his dad also bid for some cases of special wines at specialist auctions. They constructed a small bar in one of the lounges which adjoined the dining room and I worked there before suppertime, trying my best to serve occasional cocktails (hastily looking them up in a booklet) as well as serving sherry and some aperatif style wines.</p><p></p><p>We found a house nearby and moved to Friars Lane, Burnham Norton in summer 1966. We moved there on the day that England won the World Cup. Bernard cycled to the hotel from Friars Lane where we lived and I stayed at home with our young children. Occasionally I made a few American-style puddings for the restaurant, but I was very busy indeed with our family, the house and the large (one acre) garden. It was then that my formation as a cook recommenced.</p><p></p><p>What was available in local shops was limited. No garlic. No peppers or aubergines. No chillies, yogurt, skimmed milk, soured cream. No un-dyed, smoked haddock or pickled herring. No fresh or frozen orange juice, The privations and frugality brought by war had diminished but the tastes of the general population had hardened. Even in a climate which is able to provide fresh vegetables virtually all during the year, the availability of some varieties had narrowed. And, there were few native English traditions of preserving vegetables. For instance, there is no local version of salting cabbage or turnips in order to make sauerkraut…</p><p></p><p>Here, I think I must familiarize you with a bit of my own background. I was born and raised in the USA. My parents were both immigrants from Russia, from families who regarded food as fuel. Their diets were both mostly plant based, designed to outlast temporary hardships. Porridge and hot cereals in the morning. Plenty of hearty vegetable soup, hot or cold, summer or winter. Bread designed to last a week to ten days, Pickled, cured, smoked and dried meat or fish. Dried mushrooms – all of these the mainstay of a Slavic diet.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, when we moved to Burnham, four times a week there were deliveries of old-fashioned bread. I could not abide the widely available tasteless fluffy commercial bread, found in many homes and shops. And I missed many mainstays of my New York style American diet, particularly various fermented milk products. Why couldn’t I find buttermilk, soured cream – or yogurt? During my first year living in Burnham Norton, I became ill with hepatitis. Because I could not digest fat, I wanted skimmed milk – not available then, except for a powdered dry skim milk which was imported from France. One early morning, on the farm programme, we listened to some farmers complaining that they could not sell enough milk. So we wrote and suggested that they try selling skimmed milk. Quick reply – there was no demand! When we asked about selling yogurt, the answer was the same.  We sent away for some yogurt culture and began making our own…</p><p></p><p>The ethos behind the cuisine at the hotel had been one of luxury. Standards were high but appreciated. The staff working at the hotel were provided with good meals, however, they always insisted on chips rather than potatoes prepared any other way. These were cooked for them but not for the regular hotel guests, each meal.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, as I made friends and got to know my new neighbours, I became more familiar with their daily diet. We all used a local travelling butcher, Kenny Edge, from South Creake, who called once a week. When I asked him what he sold most of, he pointed to the stack of trays in his little van containing ‘pig’s fry’, that is, a mixture of offal, liver, kidneys, which was often the sole fresh meat</p><p>meal each week. The local diet would be supplemented by tinned meat (Fray Bentos and Spam), some tinned fish and the occasional fish and chips. There were travelling vans for that too.  Local meals usually included fresh vegetables. For dessert, tinned fruits and some powdered ready-to-assemble puddings were popular. Pastries included sausage rolls and Norfolk Shortcake, the latter a pastry made with lard and flour, containing dots of more lard, sugar and dried fruit. Meals were accompanied with fruit squashes. Industrial sauces and jams were on hand as well as the ordinary squidgy fluffy bread.</p><p></p><p>My children by this time were at the local primary school along the road from where we lived. Even though the school dinners there were well conceived and prepared, many families prepared packed lunches for their children. These were often poor in nutrition, but preferred by the families. The school cook’s sensible way with vegetables {‘I just show the cabbage to the hot water’, she explained) were rejected. So, when my children held a birthday party, inviting their classmates, I would receive heartfelt pleas to provide sandwiches made with ‘shoppy’ bread and jam with plenty of fruit squash as an accompaniment.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, many local families had members who were ardent wildfowlers. Pigeon, rabbit, hare and of course, dubiously obtained pheasants and partridges formed part of many local family diets. Poaching, when I first moved to England, was more prevalent as the local trains which accessed \\London would quickly ferry stuff down to the city. Nowadays, with pheasants being available so cheaply, this seems unimaginable. Then, there were weekly reports in the local  newspaper of poachers appearing before the local magistrates.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>There were also those who regularly gathered mussels, samphire and cockles. There had, over the years, been many public disagreements between authorities administering the marshes and coast over these gatherings. The uneasy balance between all these parties persists, though they all have a vested interest in preserving the coastal area.</p><p></p><p>The growing of vegetable crops became more industrialized, and ready-packed vegetables more common. There were many gangs of vegetable pickers, as well as seasonal fruit and soft fruit picker. On some farms there were travelling gangs for specialized crops, like asparagus. Some pickers were recruited locally, many of them housewives. Some of their gangmasters strutted around like cockerels…</p><p></p><p>The local diet included seasonings like mustard and horseradish. Mustard, grown locally, was dried by Colmans and sold in small tins in powdered form. It was dissolved, then left to stand for  short while before being used. Horseradish, common enough, a weed with a deep, pungent root, was grated before being combined with vinegar, sugar, salt and cream. There were a few horseradish ‘kings’ who would bring their whole families to the coast to dig for horseradish along the coastline during the winter months, Finely grated, combined with vinegar, sugar, salt and cream, it was often available and sold in small jars on stands along the roads between Lynn and Wisbech.</p><p></p><p>Parsley and mint were commonly used garden herbs. Saffron, which once was common in these parts, was largely unknown, and has only recently been revived through the offices of Dr Sally Francis, a Burnham Norton girl.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the mid 1970s that different dairy products became available in some local shops. There were even some exotic vegetables: aubergines, peppers, courgettes, chillies. More fruit: mangoes and lychees. It’s hard to imagine that salami or Brie cheese were so exotic that it took a drive to Norwich to obtain them. When  the first Leftley’s opened at the top of the High Street it seemed a boon and delight to be able to buy these things locally.</p><p></p><p>The shallow waters of our coast had been a great source of fishing for locals. Traditionally, dabs, a sort of flounder, were caught in the shallow creeks by walking around in the water with long rake-like forks with sharp prongs at the ends, which speared the fish as they swam in the shallows. \\Well trimmed, then floured and fried, these were a popular local meal. Other fishing included laying out </p><p></p><p>nets along the beaches, which brought in sea trout, flounders, sea bass and grey mullet. There were also mackerel, dogfish, occasionally brill and sole. Most of these fish, and their fishermen, have largely disappeared  now, and local yields consist of crabs, lobsters, shrimps and whelks. </p><p></p><p>Oysters are raised along the coast, in Brancaster and Morston, and mussels continue to thrive, with Frary’s in Wells the most recent mussel fishery to begin around here. Cockles, which once upon a time were gathered in Stiffkey are still there but not gathered at all. Instead they are dredged from the Wash industrially, then boiled and shelled. Alas, they are often gritty prepared this way.  But the labour involved of walking a long way to the Stiffkey shoreline, then raking them up and carrying them home in a heavy sack to prepared them, makes this an unpopular job,  Along the shores of this coast, there are some razor clams and the large, rather ugly clams, which are called, in America, Quahogs, but these are not commercial.  Samphire has only gradually become a more commercial ‘crop’. For many years it was only picked by locals for family ‘feeds’. Nowadays a commercial picker will start in late June or early July, picking it along the Essex coast, gradually moving upwards through Suffolk and Norfolk as the season wear on, before finishing in late August along the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire marshes.</p><p></p><p>When I arrived, the meals at the hotel mirrored the food found at fancy country houses. Produce which is familiar today was absent. Local ordinary housewives, largely responsible for the diet in their own homes,, concentrated mainly on the familiar foods of their past. They were largely reluctant to try anything new, even though a lot of their food was adulterated. A widespread acceptance of many commercial farming practices did not benefit their diets, nor did some of the widespread overuse of chemicals, used both in feeding livestock and spraying on the land.</p><p></p><p>The hotel began to make good money in the 60s as a result of the licensing laws and the rise of tourism. However, when old Grandma Phillips died, this had not been the case. The nearly worthless shares in the hotel she had left to her sons. She left her three daughters a house each, so that my father-in-law had to buy the house he’d built and lived in, from his sister. The shares in the hotel, then without much value, were largely ignored by the family, until it began to prosper. Then, those in the family who had possessed the previously worthless shares began to take an interest. So, they received director’s fees.  A few of them were not content and decided that they had been cheated. They had a majority of shares, and as a result, were able to take over the hotel. George and Muriel, sick at heart left The Moorings. And, Bernard lost his job.</p><p></p><p></p><p>George was ill, dying and unable to move into the house he had bought next to the friary ruins on Friars Lane, near where we lived. Bernard had to find a new job, so decided to return to Cambridge and do a one year’s teacher training course. By this time, we had four very young children. Left alone with them from Monday morning to Thursday, I had to learn to garden as well as cook while looking after the house and kids. So, I was were grateful for the school dinners which the older children enjoyed. Sadly, years later, when Mrs Thatcher’s government came to power, these dinners were cut back. Cooking equipment was removed, ready-meals offered instead. The school cook, Mrs Franklin left, but continued to prepare her lovely meals for the old folk’s club and Meals on Wheels. ‘Turkey Twizzlers’ were served at school and packed lunches, often not nourishing, became normalized. Farm work diminished. This might have some good effects – when we first moved to our house, there was an adjoining field where I could watch single farm worker, hoeing sugar beet. Starting very early in the morning, he would not have finished by the end of the day. This must have been hard and dispiriting work. By the time we moved to Wells this job was mechanized.</p><p></p><p>With the mechanization of farming, there were more second homes available. The predominant employment was provided by tourism. Many of the farm cottages, no longer required for agricultural workers, were transformed into holiday accommodation. Television cooking programmes had begun to widen the horizons of many local cooks and cumbersome, slow Baby Belling cookers had been replaced with equipment which was far more adaptable. Microwaves and freezers proliferated. Accessible supermarkets appeared,</p><p></p><p>By the time my children were teenagers, Bernard and I had started a monthly magazine devoted to</p><p>the life and issues of this particular part of Norfolk. Set in newspaper format, we had articles and news about most aspects of this area, except for food. Unable to find a cookery columnist for ‘The Paper’, I temporarily took on writing this column, using the name ‘Cocotte, which in French means a sort of casserole saucepan as well as a flirt. For a couple of years, I wrote columns concentrating on local, easily available ingredients, which were easy to prepare. I drew these from memories of Moorings Hotel meals, my own Slavic heritage, popular American recipes using some of those ingredients,  and Bernard’s and my own memories of living and working in France for three years.</p><p></p><p>About this time, ‘The Sunday Times’ ran an annual cookery contest. Wondering if I could use some of our publication’s recipes for publicity, I submitted one, a cold crab dish made with local additions: samphire and brown shrimp. I got into the quarter finals and then ended up winning the prize itself. ‘The Sunday Times’ seemed slightly lukewarm about my winning. Previous victors lived in leafy Hampstead or high class parts of Cheshire. The paper described our kitchen as ‘family battered’ and mocked our habit lf occasionally eating ‘road kill’. But, with the prize money I was able to buy a car of my own, and publish a small book of my recipes, which sold out. We were given a new gas cooker, but as we couldn’t receive natural gas, it was a Calor gas stove. Our electricity bills were reduced by a third. I was also able to take on a few catering jobs, mostly freelance, then worked at Holkham’s Ancient House for Lord Leicester and Justin de Blank.</p><p></p><p>By then, momentous changes in education had begun. Bernard was was now head of English at a big high school in Kings Lynn. He felt swamped with the increasing paperwork and the burden of administration. He loved teaching but hated the rest of his job. He longed to return to catering. And so, we started to look for a place to have a restaurant. We had lived in France for three years and holidayed there with our children. We’d particularly loved little northern French seaside towns, with their modest, comfortable restaurants in every port.  We went to Wells very often,  whether for piano lessons, the library, the wine shop at Peatling and Cawdron, the children’s swing park or just to Leftley’s, which was the nearest delicatessen dealing in a wide choice of food. \\We pictured a place near to the Quay, with the right ‘vibe’.</p><p></p><p>The cafe called ‘The Piscatorial  Emporium’ fitted the bill. It was a dinky building, obviously Georgian. But, it was not for sale. Open only six weeks a year, this was satisfactory for the then owner. But, when in the winter of 1985 it became available, we decided to try and acquire it. Needless to say, no one would lend us the money, Bank managers baulked at lending money for a property which was surrounded by 180 degrees of water. Even with Bernard’s hotel experience and my proven cookery skills, the situation seemed discouraging. Then, some local friends who we knew, who had a holiday house in North Creake, offered to provide funding. They bought the building and lent us enough money to refurbish it. With a very tight budget, a very good local builder and enough resourcefulness to equip and decorate the restaurant, using second hand catering and furnishing equipment,  making curtains and the table linen – all on a miniscule budget, we opened May 1986. We never looked back.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we couldn’t think of a name straight away. But when we asked Bernard’s mother, she wa to bes in charge of flowers – a key part, I’d always thought, of the old hotel’s charm, she said, conversationally, ‘Of course, you’ll call it ‘The Moorings’. Of course, indeed! Our culinary culture in the restaurant was a combination of our experiences, first of all the family traditions of using what was local and good. Next, the joint experiences of living and working in Paris, where I had</p><p></p><p>first learnt to cook, on often very primitive equipment. Student restaurants and domestic cooking, spurred on by Elizabeth David and Julia Child’s books as well as a French paperback primer. ‘Cuisine Pour Tous’ inspired us,. </p><p></p><p>My own Eastern European origins came in handy. The first time Bernard presented me with a kipper, I turned it into the Russian Salad I’d grown up with. My grandmother’s stuffed cabbage (which bombed when named as such, but became popular when renamed ‘Minced Venison wrapped in Savoy Cabbage leaves in a Sweet and Sour Sauce)  was equally successful. \\The easy availability of shellfish and my very American ways of preparing them, using cockles in chowder, or making crab cakes in many ways particular to their American locales: Louisiana, Baltimore, New England, meant that I was able to introduce new ways of eating familiar things. Bernard’s knowledge of smoking fish meant that we experimented, then produced, palatable smoked mussels.</p><p></p><p>We were close enough to the harbour for the local fishermen to find the way to our nack door. We told them to use the front door, especially if customers were there. We were able to get our vegetables directly from the field in Overy Staithe which had been used by the hotel. Local wildfowlers brought us a steady supply of pigeons. We had local venison, eggs from Overy Staithe and even a friend who supplied us, during all the time we were there, with quirky and wonderful ice cream.</p><p></p><p>Our suppliers became friends, as did many customers and most of our staff. Most of our children had the experience of working hard alongside us, which was of great benefit in their later life. But, the long hours and physical strain of standing in small spaces for hours on end was poor for our health. Bernard became very ill. We had to give up. Happily we were able to find a new home in this town which had truly supported us.</p><p></p><p>When we had settled into our new home on the High Street, ‘The Quay’, the Wells monthly magazine, was started. Bernard was its first editor. From its beginnings to the present I have continued to share my recipes in it – some from my catering past, others from my childhood, and  some recently encountered, all using ingredients which are locally obtainable and which can be made at home using perfectly ordinary equipment. And so, the catering connections of the Phillips family continue on.  </p><p>                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>   </p></body></html>"

But, you do need time, because this dough, containing yeast, needs to rise for a few hours. On the other hand, it is extremely cheap. Once made and cut into little squares or oblongs, it’s ready to be handed round with a drink or three. </p><p>Ingredients: 1 tsp dried yeast, 1 tblesp warm water; a pinch of sugar; 150g strong white flour; 50g brown (wholemeal) flour; 2 tblsp olive oil; 60ml water. For the topping: 600g onions, thinly sliced;2 tbls olive oil; a branch of thyme; salt and pepper; a little grated parmesan; dash of cayenne</p><p></p><p>Method: Add a small pinch of sugar to a tablespoon of warm water then soak the dried yeast in it. Leave five minutes, it should be slightly foamy. Then combine the two flours and salt. At the yeast mixture, the two tablespoons of olive oil and the water to the flour and knead the dough. If it seems dry and unyielding, add more water. All flours have different water content so it is hard to be precise. Now oil the dough lightly and place it in a bowl, cover with either film or a tea towel, then leave to rise for 1and ½ hours in a warmish place. Meanwhile make the topping. For this, heat up a large frying pan. Tip the sliced onions directly onto the hot, dry pan along with the thyme branch. Stir whilst they steam. When they are just starting to colour, add the olive oil, salt and pepper. Stir well, then lower the heat and allow the onions to cook until they are brown, caramelised, stirring occasionally. Then remove from the heat. When cool enough to handle, remove the thyme stem – the leaves will have blended in.</p><p>To bake, you need a couple of baking sheets or trays, or large pizza tins. You also need to preheat your oven to a very high temperature. </p><p>So, divide your dough. On a floured surface, roll it out very, very thinly. This dough is not at all ‘short’ so that you can be daring! Place each half of dough, thinly rolled out, on each of your baking sheets. Then divide up your onions and spread them lightly over each dough.. Finally, sprinkle with a little grated parmesan and a dash of cayenne and leave to rise for ½ hour.</p><p>Place them in a very hot oven for about 10-12 minutes. The edges should be quite brown.

This is a time when there is a good presence of various  brassica: kales, sprouting broccoli, cauliflowers. But our appetites can flag faced with these if we don’t occasionally titivate them somewhat, so I am reminding you of this Italian sauce which nicely complements these greens. You can cook these in an economical way. By putting the chopped greens into a boiling pot of water and pasta for the last 4-5 minutes of cooking, then draining it all together before immersing it in the ‘pesto’. This particular ‘winter pesto’ with easily obtained ingredients, should delight you, and if you’re only cooking the greens on their own, they will taste marvellous when strewn with this magical mixture.</p><p>Ingredients: 25g walnuts; 12g garlic, peeled; 50g grated parmesan;50 g parsley; 50ml olive oil; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Either in a food processor or stick blender crush the garlic, walnuts, parsley and parmesan together, then add the olive oil gradually.

Unfortunately, my mother disliked cooking oily fish so he had to go out to a local Russian Jewish ‘dairy’ restaurant in order to indulge. I accompanied him, so was introduced to salmon, which I now adore.</p><p></p><p>I tried to duplicate it for many years. But, on my last visit to New York a few years ago, I sampled the version sold by a very famous delicatessen. It wasn’t quite right, but I realised just what I needed to perfect my own version of this great Russian dish.</p><p></p><p>The ‘cooking’ is done through pickling – in vinegar, sugar and salt. It isn’t too light a pickle so that, like Gravlax, it will last for about a fortnight. Any sort of salmon: wild; farmed; organic, can be used. But it must be skinned, filleted and have the pin bones removed. If the fish monger or the attendant at the fish counter will not do this, just run your hand down the middle part of the fillet. The few protruding tiny bones, which you feel, are easily removed with tweezers.</p><p></p><p>This dish is ideal for parties. The given amount of pickling fluid will suffice, whether you are dealing with a half kilo of fish or three times as much. Only the amount of salt will vary.  So, in order to make one of the most requested of my recipes, here goes!</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: ½ -1 ½ kg salmon fillet, cut into generous bite sized chunks; 2 rounded teaspoons (per ½ kg of fish) of salt; 2-3 tablespoons of sugar; 1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced into half-rounds; 1 large carrot, very thinly sliced. Use a potato peeler for this.; 1 teaspoon of pickling spice; 1 teaspoon of whole peppercorns; a handful or chopped fresh dill or a good sprinkling of freeze dried dill; ½ litre of good cider vinegar. Whin Hill from Wells is ideal.</p><p></p><p>Method: Put the chunks of salmon into a bowl and sprinkle the salt over them. Spread the chunks on a cake rack to air and dry slightly while you prepare the pickle.</p><p>Combine the vinegar, sugar, peppercorns and pickling spice with the sliced onion and carrot. Bring this to the boil, then reduce to a very gentle simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, pour into a cooler jug or bowl and cool this as quickly as you can, by plunging this container into a larger bowl full of cold water. When this liquid is quite tepid, distribute the salmon chunks into a wide, low dish which has a cover (plastic versions are readily obtainable). Pour the pickling fluid over the fish chunks, then add the dill. Cover and leave in your fridge for at least 48 hours. It is then ready, and, I hope you agree, truly delicious!</p></body></html>"

When I am limited for time, or with lack of ambition, I simply supplement these with either a sandwich, baked potatoes or simple pasta, an omelette or something fishy or shell fishy, requiring no cooking.  Thus, I am furnished with one decent meal each day.</p><p>If I have some prawns, peeled shrimp, crab, cold cooked fish, I know that there’s enough for a decent salad or sandwich. Accompanied by bright, light pink sauce, ‘Marie Rose’, It’s quite a treat.</p><p>That sauce can be quickly titivated into  something grander. In New York Irish bars, when they serve prawns (or as they call them ‘shrimps’) they add a little bottled horseradish sauce to the mayonnaise-ketchup mixture. Very pleasant indeed!</p><p>But, experimenting with the tiny jar of ‘White Miso’ I bought last week at Tesco, I discovered something even better. To the standard sauce of one tablespoon of mayo to which I’ve added a single teaspoon of ketchup, I also added a single teaspoon of that miso. Now, miso is a Japanese condiment and the white variety is made from fermented bean curd. Other, darker misos are made from fermented rice or wheat. These are all particularly rich in ‘Umami’ - which means a savoury taste. Other examples include parmesan cheese, very well aged cheddar,  Thai fish sauce, anchovy essence…. You may get an idea of what this adds up to. </p><p>Anyway, add a little miso to your pink sauce and it will be elevated to the food for the gods. Try it, and see what you think.</p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

It has multiple uses, beyond pizza- a reasonable dough for quiches, and rolled thinly, a terrific wrapping for sausage rolls. It is not necessary, with this dough, to grease or oil the baking tin or sheet, It’s simple to prepare, and the result is tasty.</p><p>Ingredients: 7g dried yeast (1 teaspoon); 280g strong white flour; 70g strong brown flour; 10g salt; 50ml olive oil; water and a tiny pinch of sugar.</p><p>First of all, soak the yeast in 100ml of lightly warm, slightly sweetened water. Leave this for at least 10 minutes – it should be foamy. Then mix together the flours and salt, in a large bowl. Add the yeasty water to this and then, the olive oil. Add enough water to this to make a soft and pliable dough. Knead this together until it is smooth and flexible. If you have a dough hook on a mixer or a processor with a very strong motor, you can use this, but in any case, this shouldn’t take too long.</p><p>With oiled hands form the dough into a ball, place it in a clean bowl, and leave, covered with a tea towel or sheet of cling film, undisturbed for 2-3 hours, to rise.  Then, knock it back. It is ready for use, either now, or stored in a plastic bad in the fridge. When you use it, roll it very, very thinly – if you are worried that it may split, it can be rolled over a large piece of clingfilm, and then placed on a baking sheet. </p><p>If you are using this dough for sausage rolls, brush it with a little beaten egg before filling the dough with sausage meat. Seal it and coat it with a little more beaten egg, and the outside will appear nicely glossy.</p><p>The thinner the dough is rolled, the crisper and finer the result. Top with your favourite pizza toppings, and bake in a very hot oven, for 10-15 minutes.</p><p>When used after being refrigerated, leave it to reach room temperature before topping or filling….</p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips </p><p>  </p></body></html>"

There’s nothing so cheering as a plate or two of sliced up remains, a jar or two of homemade chutney or some sauce, perhaps a baked potato – and a salad or two to accompany it all. I have recently invented a sort of ‘slaw’, a mixture with oriental overtones which is totally suitable for these occasions.</p><p>It uses the Japanese mooli. That is the long white radish which is easily found nowadays. I’ve been buying them regularly from a Fakenham vegetable stall on market day, but wouldn’t be surprised to see them even more widely available.

Sliced thinly and sauteed, they are delicious.</p><p>They’re good in stirfries. Grated or julienned they are wonderful in salads. As in this recipe.</p><p>The quantity given here is sufficient for 5-6 portions.

So, finally I decided to try it out before simply dismissing it out-of-hand. The pastry, made with yeast, is not especially rich and is surprisingly simple to make, even if, like most yeast pastry, it does take time. But it doesn’t require hard work.</p><p>This yeast pastry is widely used in northern France and Belgium, topped with all sorts of fresh fruit in season, then dusted with sugar and butter. But this popular combination struck me as unusual, inexpensive, rewarding.</p><p>It makes a large tart, so use either a large springform pan or a pizza tray or tin. It can be made very easily in a mixer or food processor but it’s quick and simple to do without any of these bits of machinery.</p><p>Ingredients: For the pastry: 1 packet of fast action yeast; 50ml milk; 240 g ‘strong’ flour; 1 egg, lightly beaten; 50g butter, melted; 50g sugar; pinch of cinnamon; pinch of salt. For the filling: 230g pitted prunes; 150ml water; 80g sugar; small bit of cinnamon stick (2 inches or 5cm); 1 tablespoon of brandy; 1 dessertspoon of extra sugar.</p><p>Method: First of all heat themilk gently in a small saucepan until it’s slightly warmer than body temperature. Remove from the heat, then stir in the yeast. Melt the butter and leave to cool slightly while you assemble the dry ingredients. Combine the flour, sugar, pinches of cinnamon and salt. {Place them in the bowl of the mixer or processor}. Combine the ‘wet’ ingredients – that is, the egg, milk and yeast, the butter, and then beat them into the flour. Keep on beating or mixing them until you have ball which sticks together. Knead this very briefly, then place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover this with either a tea towel or cling film and leave for an hour in a warmish place.</p><p>Meanwhile, make the filling. Do this by combining the prunes, water, sugar and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Bring it to the boil and then simmer slowly until the prunes are very soft and most of the water has been absorbed. Then remove the cinnamon stick, either mash or blitz the prunes, and add the tablespoon of brandy.</p><p>After the dough has risen, lightly butter and flour your baking tin. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and then place it on the tin. Prick the dough all over with a fork, and leave it for another 20 minutes. Preheat your oven to a medium hot temperature. Dollop the puree onto the dough, then smooth it out leaving some plain pastry edging. Sprinkle the dessertspoon of sugar over this filling, then bake it for 20 minutes, until the edges are golden. </p><p>It’s served lukewarm, dusted with icing sugar, accompanied by crème fraiche.</p><p>                                                                                                                            -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

A favourite of mine, I think that the simplest Yankee recipe is the best; rich additions of cream, alcohol, boozy fruit doing no favours for this delicious pudding. </p><p>In the States, pumpkin usually comes in tins; here we have to start from scratch, with the raw pumpkin. So, split a smallish  pumpkin (say, around a kilo) in half, scoop out the seeds and fibrous bits, and roast it in a very lightly oiled tin, flat side down, for 40-60 minutes in a moderate oven until the flesh is soft when prodded. Scoop out the flesh into a bowl.</p><p>Blind bake some shortcrust pastry in a 23cm(9 inch) pie dish. (I make a very short pastry using 160g flour, 100g butter and a pinch of salt. Refrigerate for an hour before rolling out.)</p><p>Now, for the pie filling: Ingredients: 350-425 g cooked pumpkin;2 eggs; 1 tin of evaporated milk (NOT the supersweet condensed milk); ½ teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon; ½ teaspoon ground ginger; ¼ teaspoon ground cloves; 170g caster sugar.</p><p>Method: Blitz together all these ingredients until smooth. Use a blender, processor or stick blender for speed. Pour into the baked pastry shell and bake in a moderate oven for 25 minutes, then lower the heat and bake for a further 10-15 minutes, until the pie filling has set. Serve either warm or cold, with thick or whipped cream.</p><p>If your pumpkin is large and watery, you may have to drain it in a colander for an hour or two before starting to use it. And if you have too much pumpkin, you can either refrigerate it for up to five days, then make another pie, or freeze it in batches. Or, you can simply stir plain cooked pumpkin into a leek and potato soup.Without altering the taste substantially,it will turn the most appetizing looking pale orange colour!</p><p>                                                                                   -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

Cook this, stirring occasionally for at least a quarter of an hour, possibly longer if the cabbage seems tough. Correct the seasoning to suit yourself, adding more vinegar, salt, sugar, etc to suit your taste. </p><p>This is good as an added vegetable for a main meal, but is also a great accompaniment to sausage, bacon or a pork chop, or simply served on its own with simple boiled potatoes and a little hot mustard.</p><p>                                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

This is easily made, requiring almost no cooking at all as it is a simple assemblage of readily available ingredients. It can be served with hot fish, or cooled down, with a large cooked salmon or sea trout, which makes it an ideal companion if you’re cooking a big fish for a feast.</p><p>However, served simply with cooked steaks or slices of fillet, together with simple steamed new potatoes and some slightly astringent and green broccoli, sprouting broccoli or calabrese – Well! Find me something better! I dare you!</p><p>As for cooking salmon or sea trout – it’s always a matter of not overcooking your fish to the point of dryness. If the fish is to be served as steaks or slices, I salt it ten minutes before cooking, sprinkle it with a little parsley, then steam it for a very few minutes, leaving it to ‘rest’ and finish cooking as soon as it has changed colour. But if it’s a big fish, wrapping it in foil may be fine, or cooking it in a fish kettle, or even using the microwave. If it’s fresh and fine, you can’t go wrong. So, here’s the recipe for the sauce.</p><p>Ingredients: 2 large, dollopy tablespoons of mayonnaise (yes, bottled mayo will do-); a walnut-sized piece of fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated; 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard; a dessertspoon of sugar; a dessertspoon of white wine vinegar; the zest of a smallish orange; the juice of the same orange; 2 heaping tablespoons of soured cream; 2 teaspoons of drained green peppercorns.</p><p>Method: Combine all these in a saucepan and leave to stand 15 minutes. Then heat this gently, briefly (otherwise it will curdle and separate), Serve, warm or cold with your cooked fish.</p><p></p><p>                                                             -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

It’s on sale at fish shops, as well as at our beloved seafood stall on the quay, run by the Frary family.</p><p>The beautiful samphire you buy from the Frarys has been well washed, but if you do pick some yourself, try not to uproot too much of it because the roots are fulfilling a valuable ecological function. It must be washed very thoroughly to remove any mud, then either placed in the basket of a steamer or stood, roots side down, asparagus fashion, in a few inches of boiling water. Cover and cook briskly for at least seven minutes. Later in the season, it will need more time.</p><p>To test if it is done, pull a strand from the pot, run it under cold water then see if the green flesh slips easily away from its stringy stalk.</p><p>If done, remove from the heat and immerse briefly in cold water to prevent further cooking.</p><p>For easy eating, detach all the green flesh from the stalks. It should look like a brilliant green sort of pasta which drapes dramatically wherever it is laid.</p><p>I love to serve it with the following sauce which is also superb with asparagus, globe artichokes, green bans, any left-over veg and hard-boiled eggs.</p><p>INGREDIENTS</p><p>70-100g of spinach or chard leaves. The “sea spinach” which can be picked locally is very good, but wash it well! </p><p>2/3 spring onions.</p><p>1 tablespoon of wine vinegar</p><p>A handful of green herbs: parsley, fennel (wild if you can find it locally), dill, chervil, tarragon – as many of these as you can find.</p><p>Two egg yolks</p><p>300-400g sunflower or ground nut oil</p><p>Salt and pepper</p><p>METHOD</p><p>Pour boiling water over the spinach. Drain well, then squeeze it dry. Combine it with the herbs, vinegar, spring onions and egg yolks in a blender. Blend  well, gradually adding the oil until you have a rich, brilliantly green sauce. Season to taste – but remember that the samphire is already naturally salty!</p></body></html>"

Whether it’s asparagus, carrots, the first new potatoes, early broad beans – simply done, with the addition of  eggs, a little poached or steamed fish or chicken – are a great feast.

While we all studied the menu, choosing variations which would please everyone present, we were brought a large plateful of these Italian sausage rolls.</p><p> They were delicious. The filling, savoury, herbed, slightly hot. The pastry, leftover </p><p>pizza dough,  not at all stodgy. When I returned home to Norfolk, I spent some time making my own version. So here it is- fine when hot with drinks or tea and fine, cold, for picnics.</p><p>Please don’t be intimidated by pastry made with yeast. Modern powdered yeast, widely available, makes this all an easy and trouble free procedure.</p><p>Ingredients: 225g strong flour; 75g wholemeal flour; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 packet instant yeast; 2 tablespoons olive oil; water.</p><p>Method: In a food processor, combine the flours, salt and yeast. Add the olive oil, then while whizzing it add enough water to form into a ball of dough. Continue to mix until it’s smooth and malleable. Place this dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it round to grease the whole surface. Then cover it with either a damp towel or clingfilm.Leave to rise for at least an hour and a half. </p><p>For the sausage filling- Ingredients:1/2kg sausage meat; 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds; 1 clove of garlic; ½ teaspoon of oregano; 1 chilli, deveined and deseeded.</p><p>Method: Combine the ingredients in a food processor. Form into long, skinny ‘chipolata’ sized sausage shapes and leave in the fridge till you’re ready to use them.</p><p>When the pastry has doubled in size, knock it down. For ease of handling, divide it into quarters or thirds. On a cool, floured surface, roll out one of these dough sections, rolling as thinly as you can. This dough is infinitely more elastic than shortcrust or puff pastry, so be bold!</p><p>Place one of the segments of sausage on the pastry and form it into a sausage roll, ‘glueing’ it together by pressing the dough firmly. Pinch the dough at the ends together, cut it, then place with the joined edge downwards on a baking sheet. Repeat until you’ve used up all your sausage meat. If you have any dough left over at the end, you can use it for a bonus pizza- wrapped in clingfilm, the dough will be fine in the fridge for a week.</p><p>Prick the pastry all over with a fork, leave to rise for 15-20 minutes, then bake in a very hot oven for 15 minutes, until golden brown. When they’re cooked, slice into serving sized segments.</p></body></html>"

They are cook-friendly, can be made  ahead of time, then rewarmed for ten minutes in a low oven. They can also be pre-prepared , left in the fridge then baked for twenty minutes in a very hot oven.</p><p>Originally, I rolled out puff pastry  then stamped circles which I  filled and fashioned into half moons. Nowadays, I roll out the pastry thinly into a good-sized square and cut it into 3 inch (7cm) squares, then turn  into filled triangles. Much less work! </p><p>Ingredients: 1 packet of puff pastry. If you can get the sort that is made with butter, it’s nicer, otherwise the ordinary one will do.;3 large or 4 small eggs; 2 tablespoons of cream; a tablespoon of butter; salt and pepper; 2 or 3 slices of smoked salmon.</p><p>Method: Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk lightly. With a tablespoon, extract a tablespoon of the beaten egg and place in a small bowl  with the same amount of milk or water. This will be enough for sealing and glazing the pastries.</p><p>Heat the butter in a saucepan or small frying pan. Add the eggs and cream, stirring gently till it is a thick creamy curd. Immediately pace this in a cold bowl to prevent further cooking and add chopped snippets of the smoked salmon. Stir to blend.</p><p>On a lightly floured surface roll out the puff pastry as thin as you dare. Cut into squares. Brush the edges of these squares lightly with  egg wash. Place teaspoons of the filling in one corner of each square, then fold over to form triangles. Press with a fork to seal. Place the triangles on a Bakewell- paper lined pastry sheet. Brush the tops with the egg wash.</p><p>Now, chill them until 20 minutes before you are ready to bake them in a very hot oven, prior to serving. They should be a warm golden brown.

They’re landed locally, fished off the Wash, boiled at sea in seawater with additional salt. This gives them their salty but satisfying savour.</p><p>Of course, it’s nice to eat them as is – breaking off the heads, then rapidly peeling off their shells.

I know it’s a fiddly job.But these little shrimp are the business as far as taste is concerned.</p><p>Now, if you’re willing to by a cupful  without devouring them on the spot, try using a saucepan as a receptacle for their leavings. Then, you'’e well on your way to preparing a soup fit for the Gods.</p><p>Once you have your saucepan of shrimp debris, and have refrigerated the edible fleshy bits, add to your saucepan a chopped up carrot, onion, celery blade, parsley stalk and a few peppercorns, along with a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree and a full glass of white wine.

Bring to the boil, the reduce to a simmer (or leave in a gentle oven) for slightly longer than an hour.</p><p>Next, strain the stock through a fine sieve.

I used to make this out of smoked grey mullet fillets (we smoked this ourselves) but have found that commonly sold smoked mackerel, used in slightly more modest quantities, is a delicious substitute.</p><p>If the salad is all hand chopped, it’s very presentable as a salad. Otherwise, blitz it in a food processor. Then it will serve as a great spread or dip as well as a slightly smoother salad.</p><p>To give this recipe some ‘oomph’ you must use some chilli sauce to add a bit of warmth. Thai Sweet Chili Sauce won’t do for this. It’s too sweet. Use one of the commonly sold Mexican types (I use the widely available ‘Cholula’); or, in a pinch, Tabasco.</p><p>Ingredients: 250g smoked mackerel fillets; 3 blades of celery, finely chopped; 3-4 shallots, finely minced; 1 red or green pepper, very finely chopped; a handful of fresh parsley, chopped; 2-3 tablespoons of mayonnaise; a dash of ground black pepper; 1-2 teaspoons of chilli sauce. </p><p>Method: Remove the skin and any stray bones from the fish fillets and shred them. Combine with the other ingredients. For a finer texture, blitz the lot together, adding the seasonings to taste. Leave to stand for at least an hour to allow the flavours to knit together.

How would he supply delicious local bloaters for Sunday breakfasts for his customers at The Moorings Hotel in Burnham Overy Staithe?</p><p>His local fishmonger promised him a steady supply of herrings. So he appointed his son Bernard (my late husband) , his assistant at the hotel, as the new chief smoker. Bernard, a literary fellow, borrowed a book on the subject from the library and started straightaway, using an old abandoned brick outhouse opposite the hotel entrance, across the road, in the vegetable garden.</p><p>First try, the fire was too strong, there was too much sawdust and all the fish fell down. Second time, it took too long and the fish seemed hard and tasted too strong. Meanwhile, Bernard stank of smoked fish and was obliged to bathe frequently in order to rid himself of the smell before serving the evening aperitifs,</p><p>But he did master the process in very little time, and years after he had left the hotel, we always had a simple home smokery, albeit reduced in scale. Years later, when we started our restaurant, The Moorings, in Wells, we used an old disused electric cooker. In the bottom of its oven, we set a small metal tray containing sawdust. Above,on a rack, we placed the stuff we wished to smoke.This cooker was located in the back alley of the restaurant until it fell to bits. So then we used a large aluminium oriental steamer. The bottom was seriously holed. Into this, we placed an ancient enamel tray containing the sawdust. We placed a small wire rack containing whatever we wished to smoke on top of the first level of the steamer before using the lid to contain the smoke. This worked like a dream.</p><p>I’m telling you this so that so can improvise your own smoker in order to reproduce the wonderful smoked mussels which Bernard continued to provide until he became too ill.</p><p>It’s simple indeed if you can sort out a smoker and find mussels of the calibre we get in Wells, or on the Norfolk coast. It’s best to do this out-of-doors, even if it’s a city balcony or an alley, but even a fireplace might be good enough to remove any smoky fumes.</p><p>First of all, open your cleaned mussels in a very little water to which you’ve added a heaping tablespoon of salt. When the mussels are just open, remove from the shells and place them upon a wire rack on the tray of your smoker. Sort out the ‘working part’ of the smoker by lighting up a good handful of hard wood sawdust (there are many good sources for these – woodturners, Treen makers, other smokeries…use your ingenuity. Place the tray over the smouldering sawdust, cover the lot, and smoke for 40 minutes. And that is all there is to it.</p><p>These mussels are delicious served with a lemony garlic mayonnaise. Or without!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

I am not giving a recipe for a starter, as they are widely available; jars of them lingering in many people’s fridges-- I am certainly willing to share mine, as starters are easily divided and brought up to a usable amount by simply adding a couple of tablespoons of flour and enough water to bring it up to a creamy consistency, then leaving it at room temperature overnight..Starter will store well in the fridge, if occasionally renewed by being fed.</p><p></p><p>The process of making this wonderful bread takes time, but very little physical effort. And the result is so delicious, and keeps quite well so that it is very worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: The sour dough starter (you’ll only need a large tablespoon of it – say 50-60g); strong white bread flour – either 500 g, or 450g strong white and 50g of rye or whole wheat flour; 10g salt; 350ml water; a little ground rice (for dusting the final bowl containing the last proving).</p><p>Two medium to large bowls and a heavy-ish casserole with a lid for baking it – a Dutch oven or LeCreuset type casserole should do.</p><p></p><p>1. The night before starting, remove your jar of starter from the fridge. Add a large tablespoon of flour and enough water so that when you stir, it has the consistency of thick cream. Cover the jar and leave it at room temperature until the next day.</p><p>2. Next day, weigh out the flour(s) into a large bowl. Stir in the salt and then all the 350ml of water. Mix briefly and roughly, then cover the bowl with a plastic bag and leave it for an hour.</p><p>3. Now, remove the covering,  and add the sourdough starter (50-60g}. Mix this in roughly and rapidly, then cover it all with the plastic bag. Leave it for another hour.</p><p>4. Now, remove the plastic bag once more. Very gently, pick up a small strand of dough from the side of the bowl. Stretching it gently, pull this over the top of the dough – as though you were wrapping a parcel. Rotate the bowl slightly, then lift another segment of the dough, then stretch it and fold it over. Repeat this stretch and fold movement 23 more times. You should have been round the bowl, - and then some!  This is the most demanding physical effort you will be required to do! Now, cover the bowl once more, and leave it for two hours. But, during this time, repeat the dough folding and stretching- only 8-10 times a session. After the last session, cover the bowl well and leave it for a long time (8-10 hours). The dough should be more than double the size when you look at it. Finally, stretch, pull and fold the dough briefly and lightly – you want to keep those bubbles you’ve made!</p><p>5. Now, find another bowl which you can use for the final rising. Rinse or spray this bowl with water. Dust the whole of the interior with ground rice .Gently place this last bit of folded dough into the bowl. Make sure that the top of the dough has also been covered by sprinkling it with the ground rice. This prevents the loaf from sticking to the bottom of its baking pot and will make it easy to slide the dough into its final destination when baked. Very gently, slide the dough into this well sprinkled bowl, Cover it with the plastic bag and refrigerate it overnight, really anything between 7 and 22 hours.</p><p>6. Preheat your oven to hot (400’ plus). Line your cooking pot or casserole with a piece of parchment or Bakewell paper on the bottom. Remove the dough from the fridge and gently transfer it into the pot. The ground rice makes it easy to tip out when baked. Spray the inside lid with water- and bake 50-60 minutes. Remove from the oven, cool on a rack and don’t break into it until cold!</p><p>                                                                              Carla Phillips</p><p> </p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>SPICE CAKE, AMERICAN STYLE</p><p></p><p>I’d been searching for a good recipe for American-style spice cake for many, many years.  A heavenly cake where the spice is present but not too insistent and a streusel (crumble) topping that gives this cake its own icing,  and good texture and taste, this cake was particularly popular in the Mid-West and the South of the US. Various girls in my college dorm were sent versions of this by their mothers; I often looked for recipes of this particular cake which was delicious and had good ‘keeping’ qualities.</p><p>As I said, the combination of spices are not too strong. The nuts add texture and the raisins add moisture. It can be made in either an 8inch or 9inch tin; you can choose between a bigger or taller cake. And, an added advantage; no specialized equipment (mixers, etc)  are required. The only ingredient which is slightly uncommon is buttermilk, which is sold be many supermarkets and any Eastern European shop will always stock it. Buttermilk will last in a fridge for three to four weeks.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 225g plain flour; 115g butter; 280g caster sugar; 1 tsp ground cinnamon; 1 tsp ground nutmeg; ½ tsp ground allspice; 1’2 ground cloves; ½ tsp salt; 120g chopped walnuts; 120g raisins; 200cl buttermilk; 1 large egg; 1 tsp vanilla; ½ tsp bicarb of soda.</p><p>Method: Preheat oven to 370’ (medium hot).Butter and line your cake tin. Pour 200cl of very hot water over the raisins while you get together the rest of the cake.Mix together the flour, sugar, salt and spices. Add the butter and blend it in with the fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs. Then remove and set aside a cupful of this mixture. This will be the cake’s topping. Now, drain the raisins and add this to the rest of the mixture, followed by the walnuts. Mix it together well. Beat the egg lightly with the vanilla and buttermilk. Add the bicarb, mix it all together  then add the wet mixture to the rest of the cake. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin, then sprinkle the reserved dry crumb mixture over the wet mixture in the cake tin. Bake it in for 40 minutes or so – until a sharp knife inserted into the cake comes out dry. When you take it out of the oven, leave it for 10 minutes or so before turning it out of its tin, then cooling..</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

Mix together, very roughly, the flour and dry spices. Stir the bicarb into the warm water, then add the dark treacle. Now, cream the butter with the sugar, add the treacle mixture, then stir in the flour-spice mixture. Form approximately in teaspoonsfull into small balls, and place on  silicon (Bakewell paper) lined baking sheets, well apart. You should have about two dozen. Flatten these little balls by mashing them, in a criss-cross pattern, with the tines of a fork. If it seems a little sticky, dip your fork into flour. Bake these for 10-12 minutes.

She knew an awful lot about cookery. But, this was ‘Cook’s’ recipe, which had been used since Edwardian times. Her treacle sponge was incredibly popular; the grated apple and lemon flavourings cut through the extreme sweetness of the syrup. When I made it in our restaurant, using vegetarian suet (which I found to be lighter than the regular version), it was in constant demand. It can be made in a single pudding bowl or decanted into smaller bowls suitable for turning out as individual servings. This recipe will serve 4 or 5, and can always be re-steamed or heated in a microwave.</p><p>Ingredients: 120g self raising flour; 1 teaspoon baking powder; pinch of salt; 120g soft breadcrumbs; 1 level tablespoon brown sugar; 120g suet; 1 medium cooking apple, peeled and grated; zest of ½ lemon; 2 eggs; 2 eggs; juice of ½ lemon; 60ml milk; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 100ml golden syrup.</p><p>Method: Sift the flour, baking powder and pinch of salt together into a largish bowl. Add the breadcrumbs, the brown sugar, lemon zest and apple, then mix it again. Now, in a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Add the juice of the half lemon, the milk, vanilla and the golden syrup. Mix this into the dryer ingredients and spoon it into your pudding basin or individual little bowls. Cover with greaseproof or foil sheets of paper, which have a central pleated fold, so that the can expand as the puddings are cooked. You can anchor these papers with an elastic band.</p><p>Steam for 40 minutes. Turn out while still hot and serve with some golden syrup, warmed and diluted with juice from the remaining half lemon.</p><p>                                                                                                    -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

The following recipe is popular with family and friends as well as past customers.</p><p></p><p>First, however, a simple tomato sauce is required. I suppose that at a pinch you could buy one of those available in jars, but it’s simple enough to make.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 dessertspoon of olive oil; a small onion, finely chopped; 1 small clove of garlic, minced; 1 teaspoon of sugar; a small tin of tomatoes (any sort); ½ teaspoon of dried oregano; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Gently fry the onion in the olive oil, then add the garlic. Next, tip in the tin of tomatoes and also a tinful of water as well as the sugar and the oregano. Simmer this sauce for about 15 minutes, then season to taste. If you like your sauces smoooth, you can always blitz it with a blender, stick blender or processor.</p><p></p><p>Now, for the mushrooms.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: For each large mushroom- 1 sausage (I particularly like Arthur Howell’s venison sausages for this recipe}, ½ slice of bread. Soaked briefly in water, then squeezed; the stem of the mushroom you’re stuffing; a small shallot and half a clove of garlic; ½ teaspoon of fennel seeds or a small chunk of fresh fennel; a little salt and pepper. </p><p>Method: Blitz  these ingredients together. Pile them into the mushroom cap. Spoon a little tomato sauce in to a deep enough baking dish to contain the mushroom{s}. Cover with more of the tomato sauce/ Cover this dish lightly with aluminium foil, then bake it in a medium oven for 30-40 minutes.

It was late morning on the Saturday – and I would have been happy with either tickets for that afternoon or return tickets for the day following, which had been advertised as sold out. So, I rang the Maltings. The answerphone told me that the box office was open during the weekdays and Saturday. Since it was Saturday, I rang once more in the hope that the phone might be answered. No chance. Examining the ‘What’s On’ leaflet there was the suggestion that I book through ‘nnmf’ – the North Norfolk Music Festival. No phone number was given. Useless!</p><p>Why am I telling you this? It’s because this sort of thing happens all too often/ The Maltings continues to lurch from glitch to mishap without hesitation.</p><p>So why ask for suggestions about community relations. Particularly with an emphasis on the local parents and the schools. It seems silly since the person originally hired to do this job, who actually did it splendidly, was dismissed. The disregard to all of the community projects which were welcomed by the parents and schools, which were valued highly by Ofstead school inspectors and acclaimed by the BBC, were ignored by the management at the Maltings. Indeed, except for one small event at the Maltings itself, the events held in the schools, well attended by parents of this community, were not ever visited by a single trustee, as far as I can tell.</p><p>This rankled with the community at large.</p><p>Ordinary Wells people have long complained of not being listened to when suggesting things. Workshops, Craft Fairs, Mini Craft Courses, a piano in the foyer (like St Pancras), Art classes..even a book exchange...all suggestions are met with cold politeness which masks arrogant hostility.There is a feeling that the Maltings is the Keeper of a Culture which is to be doled out to the deserving.</p><p>The publicity is a joke. No posters or flyers in the surrounding villages. No efforts to link up with the neighbouring communities.No notices for children to bring home. </p><p>I note that the return address is in Barnstaple. Why there? If this is about Wells, why has it come from afar? Is this the work of a distant commercial firm? Only asking….</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                      Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>"

    "content": "<html><body><p>TURKEY TETRAZZINI</p><p></p><p>This delicious combination of pasta and turkey was a big deal in the 1950s. Named after famous opera singer Luisa Tetrazzini by a Californian chef anxious to please her, the recipe originally called for poached chicken. Like so many great dishes of that time, imitations and ‘instant’ versions of the dish gradually debased this wonderful recipe, well worthy of revival. Nowadays it’s a post Christmas star, its quality rising and falling upon the nature of the stock made from the leftover bird.</p><p>So, to make a good turkey stock use the bones, any broth or gravy you already have, together with a chopped large carrot, onion, stick or two of celery and a couple of cloves of garlic. Place these all in a large saucepan, together with a couple of bay leaves, a few peppercorns and a couple of cloves.Bring it all to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer it all together for a good hour. </p><p>Then, remove from the heat and sieve the stock into a bowl, discarding the solids. Return the liquid to the stove, and cook once more, boiling until it’s reduced to about 300-250ml.</p><p>To complete the dish you will need 350g sliced mushrooms;60g butter; 3 tablespoons of sherry (any sort); 150cl cream; 2 tablespoons of plain flour; 250g spaghetti; salt and pepper; leftover turkey meat cut into smallish pieces; 30-40g grated parmesan</p><p>Method: Make the sauce by melting half the butter, then adding the flour then adding the hot, reduced stock. Bring this to a boil, stirring the while. Reduce the heat, and allow to simmer very gently for 5 minutes. Then add the cream and sherry and season to taste.</p><p>Cook the spaghetti until it’s ‘al dente’, Drain and rinse quickly to prevent the strands from sticking together. Saute the sliced mushrooms in the rest of the butter. Then toss the spaghetti and mushrooms together with half of the sauce. Place this in a fairly large casserole or roasting tin. Stir the turkey into the remaining sauce, make a depression in the spag-mushroom mixture and spoon the turkey into it. Cover it with the grated parmesan and bake in a moderate to hottish oven for 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</p><p>The original recipe called for chopped truffles over it all- which isn’t particularly practical for present day cooks- but if you were given a bottle of truffle oil as a present, now is the time for a dribble of it over the dish as it comes out of the oven.</p><p>This recipe makes enough to serve 8-10 people—and if it seems too great an amount, it does freeze nicely</p><p></p></body></html>"

In winter, tinned or bottled fruit, including tinned pineapple, also works well.</p><p>Use apricots, peaches, plums, cut in half with the stones removed. As it is reversed onto its serving dish, remember this when placing your fruit in the cooking pan. Traditionally cooked in a heavy-bottomed skillet or frying pan with an ovenproof handle, I possess nothing suitable, so use an ordinary 9 inch (23cm) cake tin, lightly oiled and lined on the bottom with Bakewell (silicon) paper. When I turn the cake onto its platter, the results look good, even if my fingers may get a bit sticky during the reversal, peeling off the paper.</p><p>Preheat your oven to low to moderate (approx 325-350F – 170-180C)</p><p>Ingredients: 130g butter; 200g brown sugar; a punnet of apricots, peaches or plums – more if you like your fruit crowded together, as I do; 4 eggs, separated; 180g caster sugar; 120g self-raising flour; 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract; a pinch of salt</p><p>Method: In a heavy-ish saucepan, melt the butter. Before continuing further, set aside 3 teaspoons of this melted butter in a little container. Now, add the brown sugar into your saucepan. Stir until the sugar is well dissolved and only just beginning to bubble slightly. Remove this from the heat and our it into the cake tin. Now, distribute your halved and stoned fruit on top of this.</p><p>And now for the batter itself. Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff. Gradually add the caster sugar, meringue fashion.</p><p>Now, beat the egg yolks well. Add the 3 teaspoons of melted butter, then the vanilla. Fold this into the meringue mixture. Last of all sift and fold the self-raising flour into the meringue and yolk mixture. Pour this batter over the fruit mixture in the baking tin and bake it for 30-40 minutes, until it’s a lovely golden brown and the middle doesn’t wobble when lightly poked.</p><p>Reverse it onto a serving dish. It’s great when hot but also fine served cold or even gently reheated. Serve with cream, ice cream or a fruit fool.</p><p>                                                                                          -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

It was very popular,  with a substantial taste and rich texture which far exceeded its relatively simple ingredients. I still make this frequently, especially when the weather is grim.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 500g onions, halved and very thinly sliced; 1-2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely minced; 1 tablespoon of dried wild mushrooms (porcini); 250g mushrooms (very large ones or brown ‘chestnut’ ones taste best) finely sliced; 20g butter; 1 tablespoon of olive oil; 1 tablespoon of soy sauce; 1 tablespoon of sweet sherry or Marsala; 1 tablespoon of tomato puree; 300ml milk; 2 tablespoons of cream; salt and pepper; a little chopped parsley for a garnish.</p><p></p><p>Method: First of all, soak the dried mushrooms in about a teacup of boiling water, leaving them to stand while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Then, heat an empty heavy bottomed saucepan. Throw in the sliced onions, stirring wells as they start to steam and colour. Then add the butter and olive oil, and reduce the heat under them. Stir briefly, then cover and leave it all to gently cook until the onions are a rich golden brown. Now, pump up the heat and add the sliced fresh mushrooms. Stir well, then add the garlic. Strain the soaking (previously dried) mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid. Add these mushrooms to the other ingredients, mixing well. Next, add the soy sauce, sherry or Marsala, tomato puree and the soaking liquid and enough water to cover all these ingredients by about 2 inches. Simnmer this gently for about 30 minutes and then add the milk. Season to taste and finally add the cream. Garnish with a little finely chopped parsley and serve with some crusty bread.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"

    "fileName": "WINTER SOUPS.html",
    "content": "<html><body><p>WARMING SOUPS</p><p></p><p>.In an icy winter my usual strategy is to make thick vegetable soups which ‘do’ for several meals. Buying myself a stick blender (an inexpensive stout zapper which pulverizes easily and quickly) has made this an easy task. Schlepping hot mixtures from the saucepan into the blender or food processor tends to be fraught and messy. Plungeing  this little machine directly into the cooking pot- with its detachable, quickly washed out business end, has made life considerably easier. </p><p>And so to the soups themselves/ Basically, most soups start with the sauteing (or gentle frying) of onions – or several of their relatives such as leeks, shallots, spring onions, together with a potato or two. The potato adds the thickish, slightly velvety texture. From then on, you can add as much or as little as you please. You can add a little curry powder, or garlic,chilli and ginger. You can add herbs. You can throw in most vegetables: beetroot, carrots, root vegetables, squashes, celery, etc. You can certainly add any cooked leftover vegetables to hand.</p><p>Next comes stock. I use a combination of vegetable water and commercial vegetable stock powder (‘Marigold’is my preference). But you can add chicken, ham, game or beef stock, if that’s what you have and like.</p><p>But, that absolutely basic mixture of onion and potato is perfectly fine on its own. A good friend who spent a winter studying in Lisbon told me of the regular, delicious starter served up by his Portugese landlady each night.</p><p>She started bu heating up a largish saucepan, to which she added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. She cut up either one large or two medium onions which she added to the oil. Then she peeled a large potato, chopped it up and added that. She then turned down the fire under the pot, covered it, and only occasionally stirred it until the potatoes had started to soften.</p><p>To this, she added vegetable stock (about 500ml). This was brought to the boil and simmered until the potato was entirely soft. Then she removed the saucepan from the heat and shredded, very finely, some dark green cabbage or kale. </p><p>The soup was then liquidized and returned to the stove, to reheat. The shredded cabbage was chucked in to cook for barely two or three minutes, and then the soup was served. Sometimes a slice or two of chorizo or sausage went on top as a garnish, but this wasn’t an everyday occurrence.</p><p>Try this. It’s simple, cheap and tasty and helps combat those chilly winter blues.</p><p>                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>"
