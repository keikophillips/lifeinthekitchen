<body><p>A GOOD LOAF</p><p></p><p>Good bread, that is, bread made without chemical ‘improvers’ which make it fluffy, pappy, bland,- is one of my favourite things. I confess to being a ‘Breadie’ who can bore for Britain  consulting with fellow cultists.</p><p>I make my own sourdough loaf. A boast: my ‘starter’ is over 30 years old.. But, I also make a loaf or two which don’t require such forethought as sourdough, which make take 15-18 hours before the end product is ready, even though it  requires very little kneading.</p><p>So, here is a quicker bread which also needs very little effort and can be contemplated, assembled, finished in less than a long morning or an afternoon.. It also requires not very much yeast  and uses ordinary beer as a raising agent and flavour enhancer, The sugars and additional yeasts in the beer contribute to the taste and speed. For this recipe, I use very ordinary pale ale or light sort of beer- any kind will do. </p><p>I use mostly white flour, with only a quarter of the weight in whole meal, as I personally find too much brown flour in a loaf produces a stodgy, heavy loaf. But, that is my own personal preference; I leave the proportion of white to brown flour to you.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 6g dried yeast; 110ml warm water; 600g flour; 300ml beer; 12g (1 ½ tsp)salt.</p><p>Method: In a large bowl stir together 70g of the flour, the yeast and the warm water. Cover this mixture and leave it in a warmish spot for ½ hour. Then add the beer. Remaining flour and salt into the starter, incorporating it all by kneading briefly until it’s amalgamated. Cover the bowl and leave it to rise for 2 hours until it’s doubled in size. Then, with floury hands shape it into a loaf and place it on a floured baking sheet. Cover this very loosely and leave it to rise for ½ hours, while you heat your oven (220’C or 425’F). Slash a few slits in the middle of the loaf with a very sharp knife3 or razorblade, then bake for 30-35 minutes till golden. You can place a tray of warm water in the bottom of the oven to add a bit of steam, to encourage rising.</p><p>When done, cool on a rack.</p><p>                                                                                                     -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
