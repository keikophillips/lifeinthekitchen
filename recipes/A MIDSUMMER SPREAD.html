<body><p>A MIDSUMMER SPREAD</p><p></p><p>A popular sort of meal, which can be expanded or contracted, depending upon how many you have to feed – this is centred on several simply cooked ingredients, cooled and then served with a bowlful of sauce, which can be used sparingly or lavishly, depending upon the individual preference of each diner.</p><p>I know that I gave this sauce recipe in The Quay earlier on, and I am giving it again. It is easy to make, using available ingredients; it will store well in a fridge and requires no cooking at all. </p><p>Serve this sauce with cold cooked asparagus, new potatoes, basely cooked broad beans, peas, samphire, hard-boiled eggs, crab, prawns, and cold chicken…</p><p>The quickly assembled sauce contains mayonnaise (homemade or bought), Thai-style sweet chilli sauce and White Miso- also now available in supermarkets, whole (health) food chops and delis. Use only White Miso in this sauce- Brown Miso, another great ingredient, is very very different.</p><p> </p><p>The Sauce: 120g Mayonnaise; 40g White Miso; 30g Sweet Chilli Sauce; 20g Olive Oil.</p><p>Method: Weigh these into a bowl. With a fork, blend them together – then serve!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                             -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
