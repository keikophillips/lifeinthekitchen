Here is a simple recipe which can be served, first, hot, but when cold – say. the next day – are either good served on salad leaves or even better as a filling for a sandwich.</p><p>To clean them, (say, a litre of mussels for two servings), rinse them well in cold running water. Then, remove the threads tangling round their shells as well as any barnacles stuck to their shell. This can be done with a small sharp knife and is very important, as the barnacles may contain dead matter. Then rinse them well in a couple of changes of water, tapping them to discover any mussels which are open after rough treatment. Discard these. Now, cut up a few blades of celery, half an onion, some parsley stalks, and place them, with a bay leaf or two, and some peppercorns, in a large saucepan. Add a teacup of either cider, perry, white wine or vermouth, and bring this to the boil. Then, throw in the mussels, Cover the pot, and cook for a couple of minutes. Uncover the pot, stir them round, then recover the pot and cook for another two or three minutes. They should all be open. Remove the pot from the fire, and strain the mussels into a large bowl, but reserving the cooking juices. (I strain them into a colander),  then strain the juices directly into a small saucepan. Reduce these juices until you have just about two tablespoons of the mixture, which should be shiny and somewhat gloopy.  Shell the mussels and place them directly into this mixture, tossing them quickly. Spoon them into a bowl.</p><p>Make a sharpish vinaigrette using the juice of a lemon, a crushed clove of garlic, a finely chopped shallot, some chopped parsley and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard.  Gradually add a teacup of vegetable oil to this.  Spoon some of this vinaigrette over the cooked (and coated) mussels. You can serve this as is, or as a salad. But, it’s magic as a sandwich in sliced brown bread or a soft bap.</p><p>                                                                                                                   </p><p></p></body></html>
