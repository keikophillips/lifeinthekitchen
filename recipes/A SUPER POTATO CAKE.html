I suggest that you make two of these potato cakes even if there is just one of you – the remaining ‘cake’ will keep well, chilled in the fridge, for up to three days, ready to be cooked just when you need it.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 440g potatoes (approximately a pound)- peeled, and if large, cut into reasonable chunks; 1 bay leaf (optional); salt, pepper, a little grated nutmeg; chopped parsley (from 2-3 stalks); a small amount of chopped onion (approximately a tablespoon; flour – a rounded tablespoon of flour; 1 egg; 50g cheese (I use strong cheddar); breadcrumbs (the ‘Panko’ ones from Howell’s deli are particularly good; a little paprika (to make it look golden; fat: bacon fat, dripping, vegetable oil- nothing fancy.</p><p></p><p>Method: Place the potato chunks and bay leaf in salted water to cover. Bring to the boil and cook until soft (approximately 20 minutes). Drain them well and place the back in the saucepan for a minute or two until they are quite dry. Then mash them well. Season well with the salt, pepper and nutmeg, then add the chopped parsley and onion. Mix together well, then add in the egg, then the flour. Cut the cheese into slices.</p><p>Now, cover a dinner plate with breadcrumbs. Sprinkle these with paprika. Divide this potato ‘dough in half, then halve them again. Mould one of these quarters into a large-ish round cake and place it on the breadcrumbed plate. Depress the centre of it slightly and cover it with half of the cheese. Then cover this up with the other quarter. Gently form it into a neat and circular cake. With a fish slice, turn this cake round so that you have breadcrumbed the bottom. Slide this onto a tray. Now, add a few more breadcrumbs and paprika to the plate and repeat the process with the remaining potato mixture and the cheese. You should end up with two good sized potato cakes, ready to cook.</p><p>Fry them in a nice hot pan, to which you’ve added a little oil, dripping or bacon fat, cooking them until they are golden on each side. They can keep in a low oven for a while, or cooked from cold, hours later. With salad, cooked greens, - an easy, trouble free meal.</p><p>                                                                        </p><p>                                                                              -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
