<body><p>A USEFUL SAUCE</p><p></p><p>This is a particularly useful dressing for winter vegetables: cauliflower, broccoli, calabrese, leeks; it is fine spooned over them when they’ve just been steamed it when it is served cold, as leftovers, it makes for a super salad. I make enough to serve several times as it stores well. Basically, it is a ‘Sauce Vierge’, and though originally designed for serving over poached chicken ir pish, it is very nice indeed with vegetables on their own.</p><p>Ingredients: 12 pitted black olives; 2 cloves of garlic; 1 peeled shallot; a handful of fresh parsley; 2 teaspoons of capers; 1 small gherkin; 3 anchovies (from a can or jar); 1 smallish chilli, de-seeded and deveined; 2 tablespoons of wine vinegar; 3oo ml of olive oil.</p><p>Method: Place everything except the olive oil in a small bowl. Chop or sap it with a blender or stick blender, then dribble and pour in the olive oil. Pour this into a jar to store.If you are serving this hot over freshly cooked vegetables, you can further top it with some toasted breadcrumbs and a chopped hard boiled egg.</p><p>                                                                           -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
