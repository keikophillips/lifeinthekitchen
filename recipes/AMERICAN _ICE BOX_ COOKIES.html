<body><p>AMERICAN ‘ICEBOX’ COOKIES</p><p></p><p>The name indicates an era before electric refrigeration was common. This recipe came from a book published in the 60s which was an anthology of recipes culled from American collections of booklets put out as fundraisers by (mostly) rural women’s associations…. Included are contributions by the Mrs..Eisenhower and Nixon…..There are some very curious contributions: raspberry jelly (‘Jello’) salad, mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallow- but this biscuit is a terrific find. It calls for a lot of butter ,but then, will make somewhere around 100 cookies. The dough is rolled into long cylinders, then refrigerated, and then can be unwrapped, cut and baked at will. It stores – and freezes well.</p><p>Ingredients: 450g butter, at room temperature; 300g caster sugar; 1 egg; 2 tsp milk; 1 tsp vanilla; 500g flour; a pinch of salt.</p><p>Method: Cream the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, then add the egg, vanilla and milk. Finally, stir in the flour and salt. Chill this batter for approximately a half hour ,until it is able to be turned into cylinders. Make into several cylinders ,slightly bigger than 50p pieces (you can make these larger if you wish) directly onto Bakewell paper, which you roll up around the cylinders before refrigerating, at least overnight. Bake on trays lined with more Bakewell or greaseproof paper. You slice the dough as thinly as you can. And, in a moderately hot oven, they should take about 10 minutes to cook. When they are starting to brown around the edges, they are ready, though if you like them slightly more caramelized you can leave them a minute or so longer.</p><p></p><p>                                                                             -Carla Phillips</p><p>                                                           </p></body></html>
