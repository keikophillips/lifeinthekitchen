The careful following of instructions for preparing and lining of the cake tin (20cm or 8”) will insure the neat appearance.</p><p>Ingredients: 6-10 apricots, halved and stoned; 70g butter; 200g brown sugar; 2 tblsp rum; 4 eggs; 200g self-raising flour; 1 teaspoon baking powder; 150g caster sugar; pinch of salt; 1 teaspoon vanilla;. For serving whipped cream flavoured with a tablespoon of icing sugar and  a tblsp rum.</p><p>Method: First of all lightly butter the cake tin. Line the bottom of the tin with a round of Bakewell paper which should be an inch or so larger than the actual circle of the bottom of the tin. Snip the edges all round the paper so that it will fit neatly into the bottom of the tin, in order to keep the fruit topping’s juices from leaking out. Butter it lightly.</p><p>Preheat the oven to 170 (gas 3- or 325F). Now, in a frying pan, melt the butter. Remove a tablespoon of this butter and place it in a largish mixing bowl. Add the vanilla to this. Set it aside while you add the brown sugar to the melted butter, heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Now add the apricot halves and continue to cook, very briefly, until the fruit is just beginning to soften slightly. Then remove the pan from the heat, add a tablespoon of the rum and pour the lot – buttered, sugared fruit, into the cake tin.</p><p>Now, separate the eggs, placing th yolks into the bowl with melted butter and vanilla. Put the whites into a different bowl. Beat these until stiff, then fold in the caster sugar and a pinch of salt. Leaving this aside for a very short while, now beat the egg yolk, butter and vanilla mixture until it is very light. Then fold this into the stiffened egg white mixture and last of all, sift and fold the flour and baking powder into it all. Pour or spoon this over the fruit , place it on a metal tray, then bake the cake in the oven for 35-45 minutes. When done- that is, not wet when prodded with a toothpick- leave to cool for at least ½ hour before turning out. It’s also very good completely cooled. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream flavoured with some icing sugar and the remaining rum. </p><p></p><p>                                                                                             -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
