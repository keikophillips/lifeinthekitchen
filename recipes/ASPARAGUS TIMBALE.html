<html><body><p>ASPARAGUS TIMBALE</p><p></p><p>A quote from the classic American cookbook, ‘The Joy of Cooking’: “The timbale is first cousin to the reliable custard and to the flighty souffle..” Combining the good qualities of both, it is easily assembled, simple to cook, an attractive way of serving leftover food as a light main dish. It’s particularly good with asparagus, which is well in season now.</p><p>Timbales are cooked in small souffle dishes or bowls, immersed in either larger ovenproof bowls, saucepans or casserole. \the gap between the two bowls is filled with boiling water and the dish is cooked, bain-marie style, in a medium oven.</p><p>Ingredients (for two) : A couple of handfuls of asparagus, stems peeled, then steamed or cooked upright in boiling water until just firm – then rinsed in cold water to prevent further cooking;2-3 eggs; 150ml (a teacup and a half) of whole milk, or milk with a little stock or cream mixed in, gently heated; 1-2 teaspoons of grated onion; a dash of paprika; salt and pepper; a tablespoon of chopped parsley; a little grated nutmeg.</p><p>Method: use a well buttered bowl. Line the sides with the asparagus, cut into segments which will ringfence the actual custard. Mix the milk with the stock and/or cream. Beat the eggs and add the seasonings, then the heated milk. Pour this gently onto the asparagus-lined bowl, then place the bowl in the larger container. Fill the gap between with boiling water and cook for 20-30 minutes, until it is set. An inserted knife into the middle will come out clean and uncoated.Then, reverse onto a serving dish.</p><p>If you want to push the boat out a bit, you can serve it with a little hollandaise sauce. But this isn’t strictly necessary.</p><p>                                                                            -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
