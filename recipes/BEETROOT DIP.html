<body><p> BEETROOT DIP</p><p></p><p></p><p>My neighbour served it first. She’d enjoyed it when served up by her sister-in-law in Leicester. When sampled, I was enthusiastic. It’s attractive, a rich pink colour, and the taste a heady mixture of sweetness, earthiness and heat. Accompanying toast, crackers, pita bread, it is genuinely ‘more-ish’ and it keeps well, at least a week in my fridge. So, what’s to lose? It’s not expensive- so well worth a go.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 2 large or 3 medium sized raw beetroots; coarse salt; 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil; 1-2 cloves or garlic, peeled; Greek yogurt; horseradish sauce (from a jar). </p><p></p><p>Method: Slice off the woody top and ‘tail’ of the beetroot, and clean them sell. Don’t peel them but you may need to use an abrasive scrubbing cloth. Roll the beetroot in about a tablespoonful of the olive oil and sprinkle them with the coarse salt. Now wrap them well in aluminium foil and bake them in a hot oven for 40-60 minutes – until they’re tender when probed with a sharp knife. Allow them to cool. They will have absorbed almost all of the oil. When cool, cut them up and add the garlic, a couple of dollops of Greek yogurt and a couple of teaspoonsful of the horseradish sauce. Either blend these with a stick blender or whizz them in a food processor until smooth, gradually dribbling in the rest of the olive oil. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your own preference. Chill, and serve in a shallow bowl accompanied by toast, crackers or pita bread.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                       -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
