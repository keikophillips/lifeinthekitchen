<body><p>BLACKBERRY VINEGAR</p><p></p><p>September is the great month for gathering blackberries. Great on their own or combined with apples in pies and preserves, they also make a fine dry aperitif type wine. But for me, they are useful when used to make blackberry vinegar. This delicious combination of sweet and sour which has myriad undertones which make it the finest fruit vinegar around.Made with our local Whin Hill cider vinegar, it’s a winning combo.</p><p>You must leave the berries to soak in the vinegar for at least a month, ideally 6 weeks or longer. But once made and decanted into attractive bottles it’s a great present as well as a welcome addition to your larder. So, for each kilo of berries you will need a litre and a half of the vinegar. Leave the berries to soak in covered bucket , large bowl or big jar.</p><p>When you’re ready, strain off the vinegar. Leave the draining berries for long enough for them to yield as much liquid as possible. Then measure your liquid. For every litre use half the weight in sugar (any sort). Thus for a litre of vinegar, use 500 grams of sugar. Place the vinegar in a saucepan and immerse the sugar. Gradually bring it to the boil. Make sure the sugar is dissolved. Allow it to boil a minute or two, then remove from the heat. Pour this liquid into well washed narrow necked bottles (I use a measuring jug with a good spout for this),</p><p>This condiment is wonderful with game, liver and salads which include leftover savoury items. It can transform leftover gravy into a piquant sauce. Try it and see! </p></body></html>
