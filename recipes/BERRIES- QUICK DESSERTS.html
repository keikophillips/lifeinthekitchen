<body><p>MERRY BERRY PARTY</p><p></p><p>Strawberries and raspberries are some of summer’s simplest joys. Widely grown locally, they are wonderful served simply, perhaps with some sugar and cream. But, you can vary this presentation slightly. They are fine served with brown sugar. Crème fraiche or Greek yogurt thinned with a little whipped cream are nice. I’ve tried them with sprinklings of black pepper or balsamic vinegar, as suggested by cheffy friends but these haven’t been particularly appealing.</p><p>My favourite party variation of strawberries or raspberries with cream is to whip a couple of dessertspoons of caster sugar into a potful of riccotta cheese. Make sure that you pour off the slight amount of liquid on top of the cheese. Then, I whip 150-200dl of double cream and fold this into the cheese. </p><p>If this cream is left (covered with a little clingfilm) in the fridge for a couple of hours it will solidify slightly so that you can form it into a mound or cones, then stud it with the fruit- raspberries or halved strawberries. Very glam indeed.</p><p>Served with some sort of fancy biscuit- shortbread or brandy snap, say, this can be a star of any seasonal celebration. And, if it’s between adults only, you can always fold a little brandy into the ricotta-cream combo.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                    -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p>                                                                                             </p></body></html>
