<body><p>BONNE FEMME</p><p></p><p>At the end of the week, traditionally, a good French housewife would be left with very few single ingredients: a leek, one potato, an onion, a carrot, a blade or two of celery, and, perhaps, a small turnip. With all these she would assemble that classic soup- Bonne Femme- a great soup made by a good housewife .Here’s my version.</p><p>Ingredients: One of each- leek, onion, carrot, potato, turnip, and a blade or two of celery. If you wish, you can add a clove of garlic to this, but it’s not mandatory. 30G butter; a few sprigs of thyme; parsley stalks; 1 litre of vegetable stock. For serving – a little milk or cream.</p><p>Method: Clean and slice the leek, chop the onion; slice the celery and peel and chop up the carrot, potato and turnip. Heat up a large saucepan, melt the butter and then add the onion and carrot, frying them gently for a few minutes, Then add the potato, leek, turnip and celery. Add the herbs, stir them together, lower the heat and cover the pan. Leave them to cook for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Finally, add the stock and cook for another 15 minutes until the vegetables are soft.</p><p>Remove the pot from the heat, allow to stand a couple of minutes, then blitz it very well with either a stick blender, regular blender or a food processor. Then you can either declare it finished, or if you like it lusciously smooth, you can strain it through a sieve before reheating it gently and then adding milk or cream. Either way, it is mighty good!</p><p>                                                                               -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
