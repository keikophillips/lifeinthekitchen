Its main ingredient is brisket of beef and its other ingredient - onions. Nothing more, and all depends on the quality of the meat – easy to succeed in this part of the world where there are individual, dedicated butchers who are all careful about the sources of their ingredients.</p><p>Nothing more is needed, other than a sprig or two of thyme (or dried thyme if the fresh stuff is not obtainable), and a tablespoon or so of olive oil. However, you do need lots of real time for this, even though no great effort is required.</p><p></p><p>You need whole brisket, and about a kilo of it, at least. This will provide for several meals –more later, about these- and you need a kilo of onions as well. First of all, slices the onions finely. Heat up a heavy bottomed saucepan, and then toss all the onions in it. Stir them well, as they start to steam, and when they are just starting to change colour, add the olive oil and thyme, and reduce the heat. Stir them occasionally as they cook gently, until they are a caramel shade. Season them with salt and pepper, then remove the onions from the pan and turn up the heat once again. </p><p> Now, brown the brisket thoroughly on all sides. Once this is done, remove the meat, add the onions, place the meat on top, then either cover the saucepan, reducing the heat underneath to the minimum possible, or place the covered saucepan in a very slow oven, or transfer the contents into an ovenproof casserole before placing it in a very slow oven. If you have a slow cooker, this is a time to use it.</p><p>Don’t add any liquid. And, take your time before looking at it; this recipe takes at least four to five hours to cook. I usually remove it from the heat, allowing it to cool completely. Then. I skim off most of the fat which has risen to the top before reheating it for about a half hour.It’s superb served with Yorkshire pudding and roasties. The onion gravy works a treat. Sliced thinly, it should be a faint pink colour in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Next day, the cold remains of the meat, thinly sliced, make perfect sandwiches. Then, there is a perfect cottage pie, using some of the gravy. And finally, if there is any of the sauce left, add some red wine to it, and a little water. Heat these up, place some croutons or dried bread on it, grate some gruyere cheese over the lot, and grill it briefly. Voila! Onion soup, French style!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                              -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
