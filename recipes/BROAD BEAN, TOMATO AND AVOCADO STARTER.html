<html><body><p>USING THE BEANS</p><p></p><p>As I write this, the weather is still reasonable, lettuce and salad ingredients still abundant, as well as green beans – runner or French- so that the salad I am suggesting is a suitable lunch, starter or accompaniment dish. I have also added sliced tomatoes or a small sliced avocado to this. It tastes and looks fresh, seasonable. </p><p>The dressing, once made, is a laster. It is delicious with hard boiled eggs and cold cooked (NOT overcooked) broccoli.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: For the salad, lettuce, cold cooked green beans, with optional extras: sliced ripe tomatoes, avocado, etc; half a shallot chopped with a small handful of dill or fennel or tarragon.</p><p>For the dressing: 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard; 1 clove of garlic; ½ teacup of boiling water; juice of half a lemon; 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil; a little vinegar (wine or cider).</p><p>Method: Prepare the salad ingredients, topping them with the green beans, then the chopped shallot and herb.  To make the dressing, mix the mustard and garlic in a smallish bowl using a stick blender (Or use a processor or ordinary blender).  Gradually trickle in the hot water. Then add the lemon juice. Now trickle in the olive oil, and last of all add vinegar to taste.</p><p></p><p>                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
