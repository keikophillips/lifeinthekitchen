<body><p>BROAD BEANS</p><p></p><p>The best broad beans are those you’ve picked early. While they’re still quite small. These are a ‘good feed’ raw, just podded, wih an accompaniment of a a few shavings or slivers of  Peccorino, Parmesan or mature cheddar cheese. Good for a snack, or even an informal preliminary to a meal. This one was introduced to me by my Italian daughter-in-law.</p><p>In fact, if the broad beans are immature enough, you can treat them as if they were regular green beans, that is, cooking them briefly, draining them and serving with just a little butter.</p><p>My favourite way of cooking fresh, youngish broad beans is to pod them and throw them into fiercely boiling unsalted water for only three or four minutes. Then drain them, add salt and pepper and a tablespoon of cream or crème fraiche. Delicious!</p><p>Once the broad beans are large with tough skins, it’s worth skinning them once cooked. I know this is a bit tedious, but when the skins are discarded, the inner beans are very fine indeed – nice by themselves, but a gorgeous addition to an ordinary tossed salad. Here is a nice vinagrette for this sort of summer salad.</p><p>Ingredients: 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar; 1 clove of garlic; 1 small shallot; a handful of parsley; salt and pepper; 4-6 tablespoons of olive oil.</p><p>Method: Make this if you can with either a blender or stick blender. Mix together the vinegar with the garlic, shallot, parsley. Blend these well. Then trickle in the olive oil, and last of all season to taste. When this is well blended it can be decanted into either a squeezy bottle or a well rinsed out plastic ketchup bottle, to be squeezed out onto the salad. It stores well at room temperatures.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
