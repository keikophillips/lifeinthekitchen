<html><body><p>BROCCOLI QUICKIE</p><p></p><p>One of the quickest delicious meals, carrying no particular burden of using a lot of  kitchen  apparatus-</p><p>Here is a current, favourite pasta dish. Only using two pans, with pasta and some sort of greens—broccoli, broccoli rabe, sprouting broccoli,calabrese- are my choices, here is a good dish for one or two people.</p><p>Per serving, I use around 70-80 grams of pasta, preferring tagliatelle or some sort of noodle (papardelle would serve, as well).  As for the greens, I use about a handful  or so, per person , about a generous normal serving. I cut the broccoli, etc, into smallish, bite size pieces, and if any bit of it is tough, I will peel it. This only takes seconds. For the sauce,  I use a couple of tablespoons of cream (about 50-60ml), and 40-50 grams of grated parmesan cheese. </p><p>So, here goes: first boil your salted water. Then, throw in the pasta. In a separate saucepan, gently heat up the cream. Three minutes before the pasta is done, add the greens into the boiling water, and stir briefly with a fork. While that is finishing cooking, add the cheese to the cream, stirring until the cheese is dissolved and the sauce is unctuous. Season to taste. When the pasta is cooked, drain  it rapidly and add the pasta-broccoli mixture to the creamy sauce. Mix well, season, and if you want a perfect but rich little addition to make it all a bit glossier, add a small ‘nut’ of butter/ </p><p></p><p>                                                            -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
