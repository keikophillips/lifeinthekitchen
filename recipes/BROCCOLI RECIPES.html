<body><p>CHEAP!</p><p></p><p>First of all – a ‘cheap’ recipe has no meaning at all, unless it’s going to be consumed. So make sure it’s diner-friendly. Second, have more than one use at one meal in mind for your ingredients.  It’s a good idea to think of some vegetables- seasonable, sustainable, as the basis for your meal, with the protein as a welcome ‘add-on’, which provides taste as well as nourishment. Another tip: spend what you can on a store of ingredients which can enhance anything – anchovies, gherkins, dried chillies, olives, as well as cheese- cheddar, parmesan…These are all often cheapest at market stalls.</p><p>Anyway, here are a few recipes, in season now, using either broccoli, sprouting broccoli or calabrese, which help make a satisfactory and simple meal.</p><p>Broccoli and pasta with a savoury sauce: Ingredients: for each 100g serving of pasta, a handful of broccoli, calabrese, etc per person. These should be cut into small, bite sized bits with any hard stems peeled. This way there should be lots. For the sauce; 1 clove of garlic; a teaspoon of capers or finely chopped gherkins; a tablespoon of black olives, pitted; two anchovies; either a minced fresh chilliu (de-seeded if you don’t like heat) or a soaked dried chilli; a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.</p><p>Method: Boil up your salted water for the pasta. Take note of the cooking time indicated on the package. When the water is boiling, immerse the pasta, and finely chop the sauce ingredients together. Four minutes before the pasta is supposed to be ready, throw in the broccoli (or calabrese, etc). When the pasta, etc is cooked, drain, leaving a little liquid in the pan and then mix in your sauce.</p><p>Next recipe for the same ingredients. Cook the pasta and broccoli in exactly the same way. Combine them, this time, with a tablespoon of parmesan per person mixed with a tablespoon of cream (any sort).</p><p>This will seem rich, but very very satisfactory.</p><p>Third and last recipe- If you have any fresh broccoli left over, immerse it in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain and rinse in cold water. This can either be incorporated into a mixed salad, served with a mustardy vinaigrette, or will be a welcome and colourful addition to any stir fry. And, if you have any leftover mashed potato and a few eggs, you can make an absolute corker of a dish:</p><p>Ingredients: Mashed potatoes; Cooked broccoli; Cheese Sauce made with 300ml milk; a tablespoon of flour; tablespoon of butter; a teaspoon of mustard (any sort); 80-100g cheese; 1 or 2 poached eggs; a little grated cheese for the topping.</p><p>Method: Oil or butter a deepish ovenproof dish. Place mashed potatoes on the bottom, topping it with the cooked greens. Poach your eggs (1 or 2 per person), and spoon these onto the greens. Top with the cheese sauce, then the grated cheese and place in a nicely heated oven. In about 10-12 minutes it should be heated through, bubbly and utterly delicious.</p><p></p><p>                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
