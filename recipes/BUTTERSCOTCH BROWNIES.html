Also, given that this is Fair Trade time, the ingredients, at least some of them, are appropriate.</p><p>Made in a single saucepan, it doesn’t require much equipment, other than a Swiss roll tin (33x23) which has either been greased and floured or lined with silicon paper.</p><p>Ingredients: 120g butter; 200g dark muscovado sugar; 120g light raw cane sugar; 2 eggs; 230g self raising flour mixed with 1 tsp salt; 2 tsp vanilla extract; 80g chopped nuts or 100g dark chocolate, crushed.</p><p>Method: Preheat oven to medium. Melt the butter, then stir in the sugars until dissolved and just starting to bubble. Remove the pan from the heat and leve it for a minute or two. Then beat in the egs, the vanilla and add the flour. Last of all add either the nuts or the chopped chocolate. Pour this mixture into the tin and bake for 15-25 minutes, that is, until it has browned and is starting to crust around the edges. Slice into squares or bars, which you can store in an air-tight container,</p><p>                                                                               -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
