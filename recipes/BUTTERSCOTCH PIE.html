Use a largish pie tin. </p><p>For the filling: 500 ml whole milk; 120 ml double cream; 3 level tablespoons of cornflour; 120g butter; 90g light brown sugar; 120g dark brown sugar; 1 level teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.</p><p>Method: First prepare and cook the crust. Next, mix the milk and cream together. Set aside a teacup of it, but heat the rest. Set aside a couple of teaspoons of the butter, but combine the rest, together with the sugars and salt in another saucepan and cook these together until they sizzle. Then stir in a couple of tablespoons of hot water to dissolve the mixture completely.</p><p>Now, combine the set aside cold milk-cream mixture with the cornflour, and stir this into the rest of the heated milk and cream. Stir this into the brown sugar and butter mixture. Continue to cook this, stirring continuously until the mixture has thickened and just started to bubble. The colour should darken slightly. Remove the pan from the fire, add the remaining butter and the vanilla. This will stop the filling from cooking any more. Pour the mixture into the prepared crus, and leave it to cool. Top with whipped cream (I sometimes stir a little rum into this) – or just serve with a little crème fraiche.</p><p>                                                                              -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
