<html><body><p>CARAMEL BUTTERSCOTCH CAKE</p><p></p><p>Rich, sweet – though not as sickeningly sweet as many other versions of this recipe, I like to bake it in two square 20 x 20cm pans, then cut in half, for two layered loaf-shaped cakes, but a couple of round pans  will certainly suffice.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients- for the cake: 200g butter; 50g light brown sugar; 50g dark brown sugar; 50g caster sugar; 3 eggs; 250g self raising flour, sifted with 1 tsp baking powder; 1 tsp salt; 1 tsp vanilla extract; 100g Greek yogurt.</p><p>Ingredients-for the icing: 125g light brown sugar; 125g dark brown sugar; 160ml cream (single or double); 50g butter; 1 tsp salt; 1 tsp vanilla extract</p><p></p><p>Method: Cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs, one by one.Then add the vanilla. Alternatively, add dollops of the flour and the yogurt. Spread into two plans lined with Bakewell paper, and bake at medium (350’) heat for 20 minutes, until they are golden brown on top. Leave to cool in their pans, and they’ll be easier to tip out for assembling.</p><p>|For the icing- slowly warm together the sugars, salt and cream in a saucepan. When dissolved, up the heat and with out stirring, bring to a soft boil stage (238’). Remove from the heat, add the butter, vanilla, then stir well, before beating it with a fork until it is a spreadable consistency, then ice the cakes. Leave to stand until thoroughly cool before cutting.</p><p></p><p>                                                                    -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
