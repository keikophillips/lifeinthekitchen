What a good idea for a convenience food, I thought, and resolved to try making my own and see how it kept.</p><p>Well, this is a really handy little item.. Cut up and sliced very thinly, cooked slowly in olive oil, occasionally stirred, seasoned with a little salt and pepper and a thyme branch or two until they are a comfortably beige mixture â€“ these are then ready for anything. Chilled in a wide mouthed jar, these have been real little time savers.</p><p>How have I used my first batch? First as a tartlet filling, topped with grated cheese, one egg and a little cream. Secondly, as the topping for an omelette. Third, briefly reheated till just starting to sizzle, in a sausage sandwich. My first batch, made from three medium onions, fitted into a large, well-packed yogurt carton This lasted three weeks.. I can see that they will save time making soup or sauces.</p><p></p><p>                                                                -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
