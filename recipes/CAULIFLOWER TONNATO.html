<body><p>CAULIFLOWER TONNATO</p><p></p><p>I found this recipe in a very old newspaper cutting which dislodged itself from another ancient clipping filed away in an album. It dates from the late 70s and is originally American- measurements in ‘cups’ and specifying a ‘can’ of tuna. Terrifically tasty, originating from an Italian classic sauce traditionally served with veal, it makes a perfect starter when served in small portions on some lettuce leaves and is a grand lunchtime salad, Please don’t be put off by the notion of this combination, even the most rabid fish rejector may enjoy this.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 large cauliflower cut into florets; a normal sized tin or tuna steak orchunks in oil, drained; 1 small chopped onion, chopped;2 hard boiled eggs; 2 tblsp capers; 2 tblsp chopped parsley; 1 clove of garlic; 3-4 tblsp of wine vinegar; salt and pepper to taste; 150 ml olive oil; optional -4 anchovy fillets.</p><p></p><p>Method: Blanch the cauliflower florets in boiling water for 3 minutes, Drain them and refresh the under cold water. Set them aside in either a shallow bowl or wide but not to deep serving dish.</p><p>Using a food processor or stick blender, zap the tuna together with the eggs, onion, garlic, capers, parsley and vinegar (and the anchovies, if using them(. Slowly add the olive oil to the mix. You should have a thick, smooth sauce. Taste and season it. Pour the sauce over the cauli and refrigerate until needed. Serve over lettuce, garnished with more chopped parsley. There may seem to be too much sauce at the start, but it is surprising how much is absorbed.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                               -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                          </p></body></html>
