This recipe dates from the time when grand chefs named sumptuous dishes after celebrities. Think Peach Melba or Omelette Arnold Bennett.</p><p>Anyway, the silky richness of this dish was particularly popular with diners in our restaurant; mostly because of the egg yolk addition rather than the cream and cheese which were more modest in amounts. The ingredients are simple enough but there are several stages to the dish, none difficult or requiring too much fiddling about, and indeed, it can be made well in advance.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients (for 4 people): 2 Large cooked chicken breasts; 250g small button mushrooms; ½  litre of milk; 250g chopped onions; 70g flour; 4 egg yolks; 100g butter; 1 tablespoon double cream; 50g grated gruyere or parmesan (or a mixture);2 teaspoons of sherry; salt; pepper; cayenne; nutmeg; paprika; a little more grated cheese for topping.</p><p></p><p>Method: Heat the chopped onion gradually in the milk. Bring it just to a simmer, then turn off the heat and let it steep until the liquid is cool. Meanwhile, remove the skin and bones from the chicken and chop it into smallish chunks.</p><p>Chop the mushrooms very, very finely. Without using any fat, cook them in a frying pan, stirring, until all their moisture has evaporated. This will take from 7 to 10 minutes.</p><p>Now make the first part of the sauce. Strain the milk, discarding the onions. Make a cream sauce with this liquid, half the butter and all the flour. Stir until it’s thickened, just starting to bubble, then season with the sherry, salt and pepper.</p><p>Now, whisk the egg yolks. Divide into two bowls. Add some of the cream sauce to one of these bowls, then stir this back into the whole sauce. Add a dash of cayenne and some grated nutmeg, and finally, the cream.</p><p>Add a third of this sauce to the chopped mushrooms and mix well. </p><p>As to the remaining sauces, add the rest of the egg yolks, most of the remaining butter and the grated cheese.</p><p>Now, to assemble. Coat the chicken chunks with the mushroom mixture and place these in a buttered gratin dish. Coat the whole with the remaining cheese sauce, then cover with the little bit of grated cheese, some paprika and the few dots of the remaining butter.</p><p>Bake this in a very hot oven for 12-15 minutes, then serve it with very plain but colourful vegetables: greens, carrots, etc. Very more-ish!</p><p>                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
