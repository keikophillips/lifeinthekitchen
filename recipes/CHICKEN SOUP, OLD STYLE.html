Add 2 litres of water to them, then on top of the stove, bring it to the boil. Simmer for an hour and a half, then add 2 teaspoons of salt, the vegetables, and cook for an hour longer. Then, strain the soup.</p><p>For the dumplings: 75g of pulverised matzos (matzo meal); 2 eggs, separated; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold in the lightly beaten yolks, then the matzo meal and salt. Cover the bowl and chill for a half hour. Then bring a pan of water to the boil. Form the dumpling batter into smallish balls and drop them into the boiling water. Simmer them for 20 minutes. If you cook them in the actual soup they will soak up so much liquid that you won’t have enough soup to go round.</p><p> Just before you need to serve the soup, bring both pots to the boil, then slide the dumplings into the hot soup. Garnish with a little chopped parsley. </p><p>                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
