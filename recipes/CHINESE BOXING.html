<html><body><p>CHINESE BOXING</p><p></p><p>A one-person show, if good, can be incredibly powerful. ‘Chinese Boxing’ written and acted by Mark Kitto, is a re-enactment of the Boxer Uprising, at the start of the last century: a historic event when all the Western embassies (plus the Japanese) were held under siege for 55 days until they were relieved by the arrival of troops led by the British. Starting as a lecture and lantern slide show set at least a century ago, this took place on Friday evening at Wells Maltings. The author, a longtime Norfolk resident who lives locally has been touring the country with this performance.</p><p></p><p>It was entrancing. Diplomats (British and Chinese), soldiers, Chinese courtiers, sounds from the Dowager \Empress. The distant and not so distant  sounds of gunfire – all brilliantly evoked. Greed, revenge, snobbery, prejudice, plus the knowledge of Chinese history and customs, all revealed in this portrayal of a momentous historical event which inevitably echoes today. We ignore history at our peril.</p><p>Narration, acting, sounds and strikingly attractive set and costumes were all faultless. It  seems amazing to be so fired up by this evocation of a historically remote event, but clear repercussions have trickled down to the present. This production is travelling all over the place. If possible, don’t miss it!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                          -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
