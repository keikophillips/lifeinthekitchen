Through the years drinking chocolate was replaced by cocoa powder, the sugar content lessened’ a little marmalade was added; it became smaller, more delicious.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients for the body of the cake: 1 small orange- separated into its zest and juice; the zest and juice of ½ of a lemon; 100g of softened butter; 80g caster sugar; 2 eggs; 100g self raising flour sifted with 20g cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder and a good pinch of salt; the juice of the orange and half lemon. </p><p>For the filling and icing of the cake: a few teaspoons of marmalade; a small orange, separated into juice and zest; the zest and juice of the remaining lemon half; 30g cocoa powder; 40g butter; 150g icing sugar,</p><p>A 7 inch (17 ½) baking tin, lined with paper and a medium hot oven.</p><p></p><p>Method: Beat the softened butter with the fruit zests and sugar until the mixture is light and creamy, Add the eggs and beat until smooth. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients, then the juices. Pour the batter into the cake tin, then bake for 35 minutes. If it looks as though it is starting to brown on its top too early, place a baking sheet in the tin top until the time is up. Then the cake should just be starting to pull away from the sides of the tin. Allow it to cool for 5 minutes before turning it onto a rack, till cool.</p><p></p><p>When the cake is completely cool, cut through the middler, in order to have two layers. Spread these two halves with a very thin coating of marmalade. Then make the filling and icing by heating the juices and zests of the orange and half lemon with the cutter and cocoa powder, stirring well until they are dissolved. Add in all the icing sugar and stir well until smooth, Then remove it all from the heat, keeping on stirring until it thickens into a spreadable paste. Place some of this paste onto one of the layers, spreading it rapidly and cover with the remaining half. \finish  by icing the top and sides of the whole cake. If it is a little too thick, use a spatula dipped into a little water. It should be shiny, smooth and glossy.    </p></body></html>
