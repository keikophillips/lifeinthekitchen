When I make it for a lot of people I will use a nine inch spring-form baking tin, and double the recipe, but if it’s for 8-10 people make it in an eight inch spring form tin.</p><p></p><p>Shortbread base- Ingredients: 25g hazelnuts, toasted, skins rubbed off; 3 tablespoons sugar; 75g  flour; 50g butter; 15g cocoa; pinch of salt</p><p>Method: Pulse the nuts in a processor with the sugar until the nuts are finely chopped. Add the rest of the ingredients and pulse until a dough forms. Press this into a 20cm (8 inch) springform pan. Prick it with a knife or fork all over, then bake for 20 minutes at 180’c.</p><p></p><p>Mousse- Make this while the base is cooling.-Ingredients: 1 teaspoon gelatine; 2 tablespoons of cold water; 150g chocolate hazelnut spread (Nutella); 120g Mascarpone: 350ml cream (double or whipping); 50g sugar; 75g cocoa</p><p>Method: Sprinkle the gelatine into the water and warm in a bowl immersed over hot water, leaving it to soften, then melted. Then beat in the chocolate hazelnut spread until combined. Remove from the heat. Whisk it  into the Mascarpone in a large bowl. In another largish bowl, combine and beat together the cream, cocoa powder and sugar until the cream forms soft peaks. Whisk a third of this into the chocolate hazelnut mixture, then fold in the rest. Spoon this over the crust (still in its tin) and chill for at least 3 hours.</p><p></p><p>The Ganache Topping- Ingredients- 100ml cream; 100g chocolate, chopped</p><p>Method: Bring the cream to a simmer in a heavy saucepan. Remove from the heat and then add the chocolate. Leave it to stand for a minute, the whisk until it’s completely smooth. Transfer this to a small bowl, stirring occasionally until it is slightly thickened. Run a warm thin knife around the inside of the springform pan, then remove the side. Slide the cake off of the bottom and transfer to a serving dish. Pour the ganache onto the top of the cake, then spread slightly, allowing the excess to drip down the sides.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
