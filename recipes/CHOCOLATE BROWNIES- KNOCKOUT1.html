But a recent trip to New York City to visit my eldest daughter has changed my mind completely. She served the following recipe up, and like everyone else present, I couldn’t wait to get the recipe. As you will see, when you examine the ingredients, they are massively rich in chocolate. Please use decent chocolate, with at least 60% cocoa butter content! But, they are really easy and quick to make, and even though the original recipe called for massive slices, smaller and daintier slices seem fine to me.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 230g dark chocolate, 140g of it chopped or hammered into small chunks or shards; 125g butter; 250g sugar; 1 tsp vanilla essence; 90g plain flour; 2 eggs, at room temperature; a pinch of salt if you use unsalted butter. Use a 20cm (8inch) square baking tin or dish, lined with Bakewell paper.</p><p></p><p>Method: Melt the butter and 90g of the chocolate together- either in a microwave or a bowl set well above simmering water, Stir to blend, then remove from the heat. Mix together, in a  separate bowl, the eggs, sugar and flour. Then blend them with the butter-chocolate mixture, stir in the vanilla essence, and last of all, the remaining chocolate chunks. Put this into the baking tin or dish, and bake it in a moderately hot oven (180C or 350F) for 10-12 minutes – an inserted toothpick should come out clean. Transfer the baking tin to a rack and leave to cool before slicing.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                          -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
