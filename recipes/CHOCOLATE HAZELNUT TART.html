<body><p>FAIR TRADE TREAT</p><p></p><p>It’s Fairtrade Month again, and this is an indulgent recipe using fine ingredients sourced from the Third World. Safe in the knowledge that the real producers of these good cooking and eating materials are actually receiving a fair return for their labour, we can enjoy this heavenly tart which doesn’t require very much work.</p><p>Lots of Fairtrade ingredients are directed towards that well known British characteristic, the Sweet Tooth. This recipe is very rich indeed, and perfect for special occasions; I suggest serving it in little wedges rather than hearty slices. Unless, of course, you are entertaining a Chocohalic….</p><p></p><p>CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT TART</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: for the base- either an ordinary baked blind pastry shell (for a 23cm (9inch) tin or a biscuit base using approximately 150gm of crushed digestive biscuits or chocolate biscuits and 100 gm of melted butter. These should be mixed, pressed into the tin, then baked in a low oven for 10 minutes. In any case, the crust for this tart must be cool.</p><p>Ingredients for the filling: 120gm of hazelnuts, toasted, then chopped or crushed finely; 300 gm of dark chocolate; 150 gm of chocolate-nut spread ; 220ml double cream; a pinch of salt.</p><p>Method: Simplicity itself. Break the chocolate into finish pieces. Bring the cream to the boil, then add the chocolate pieces, and remove the cream from the fire. Whisk until it is smooth. Then, add the chocolate spread, then the chopped nuts and a pinch of salt. Mix it together, then pour onto the crust and cool the pie until set. </p><p>As I said before, the Fairtrade ingredients are particularly fine in this recipe, especially the chocolate spread. </p><p>                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
