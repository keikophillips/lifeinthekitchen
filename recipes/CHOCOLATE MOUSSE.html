As it’s Fairtrade Month, with its products widely available through the Methodists and Friends, the WI, the Farmers’ Markets etc., their chocolate tastes absolutely wonderful as well as being a genuinely politically correct product – not the result of human exploitation, and decidedly better tasting than many more established brands.</p><p>So, here we have the simplest recipe for Chocolate Mousse. It will feed three or four and is easily achieved by anyone,</p><p></p><p>Ingredients</p><p></p><p>100g dark (Fairtrade) good quality chocolate</p><p>25 g unsalted butter</p><p>40g caster sugar</p><p>3 eggs, whites separated from yolks</p><p></p><p>Method</p><p></p><p>Melt the chocolate by placing it in a bowl with the butter and sugar over (not immersed in) simmering water. When these are melted and blended, stir in the egg yolks. Remove from the heat.</p><p>Now whip the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold the chocolate mixture into the egg whites then chill this mixture for at least half an hour. Serve with cream.</p><p>You can vary this by adding biscuits or sponge fingers, which have been soaked in sherry, rum or brandy. Or you can put the mixture into a Swiss-roll tin, which has been lined with buttered paper, and bake it for ten minutes. It will swell up then collapse, but it can be covered with whipped cream and rolled up, becoming Chocolate Roulade.</p><p></p><p>Cheer up, everyone! Spring is coming!</p><p> </p></body></html>
