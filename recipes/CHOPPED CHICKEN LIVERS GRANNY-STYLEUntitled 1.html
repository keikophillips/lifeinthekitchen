The most tasty was her chopped liver s[read, which was for parties, some sort of family gathering. Served on little slices of rye bread, with nice sour dill pickles, it was always a treat. It is one dish I could probably make in my sleep (from having observed it made, many times). Made of very few ingredients, its rich texture and fine taste make it an eternal delight.</p><p>Ingredients: 2 tablespoons of either chicken, duck or goose fat; 1  medium onion thinly sliced; 1 package (225g) chicken livers, drained (don’t use anychicken hearts if they are included); 2-3 hard boiled eggs; 1 generous handful of parsley; salt; pepper; a branch or two of fresh thyme: optional: 1 teaspoon of soy sauce; 2 teaspoons of sweet sherry, marsala or port.</p><p>Method: In a well heated frying pan, dissolve the fat with the thyme branch and the onion. Add a little salt and pepper,  and fry until the onions are just starting to soften. Then, up the heat a little and fry the chicken livers until they are browned and cooked,but still slightly pink. Now, place these in a food processor, with the parsley and hard boiled eggs. Blitz, taste, then add any seasoning needed. Spoon it into a bowl, cover it well and chill it, at least overnight.</p><p>My grandmother, not having a food processor, had a curved chopper and a gently curving bowl- reminiscent of the Italian ‘mezzaluna’ which she used to chop the whole thing together when cooked, but the modern processor gives much the same effect.</p><p>                                                                                 -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
