Consulting ‘the net’  I realized that this was the name of a sort of pudding baked in a glass baking dish – and also found this recipe, the true ‘Classic Impossible’, which I tried out. The original ‘classic’ was gynormous, and slightly too sweet, and given in American cup measures.So, here is my modified recipe, which  I halved, and this will serve 2 or 3 portions. It’s a sort of custard pie, and is ridiculously economical and easy to make, It’s best made in a flattish glass container,  like a pie dish or one of those old Pyrex baking dishes which seem to be in many un-’decluttered’ kitchens.</p><p>Ingredients: 1 glass baking dish, well buttered with about 10g of butter. 2 eggs; 90g sugar; 35g dessicated coconut; 35g flour; 240ml whole milk; 1 tsp vanilla extract; a little grated nutmeg.</p><p>Method: In a jug or bowl, combine the eggs, milk, sugar, coconut, flour and vanilla. Blitz with a stick blender then pour into the buttered dish. Sprinkle the nutmeg over it. Bake in a moderate oven for 35-40 minutes, until just set and beginning to pull away from the edge. Nice served with a little cream.</p><p>                                                                                                  -Carla Phillips </p><p>                                                                                                          </p></body></html>
