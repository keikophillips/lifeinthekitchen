I suppose that everyone expects a ‘Yank’ like me to know all about cornbread, and everyone who has sampled its posh cousin, spoonbread wants that recipe.</p><p>They both use maize meal, that quintessential New World ingredient, universally adopted and familiar in African, Eastern European, Spanish and Italian cuisine. Of course, I’m talking about ‘Polenta’ which is the same as cornmeal as far as I can tell. It’s widely available, commonly found at delicatessens, health food stalls and shops (in Wells at Nobby’s).</p><p>For cornbread: Ingredients: 90g self raising flour; 100g polenta; 60g sugar; salt; 1 egg; 2 tablespoons of either oil, melted butter or dripping; 150ml milk.</p><p>Method: First, oil a 20cm x 20xm pan and place it in a hot (220c,gas7) oven. Then combine the dry ingredients. Mix the egg, fat and milk together and stir this into the dry ingredients rapidly. Pour into the tin, and cook for 25-30 minutes. Halfway through the cooking you can add little bits and bobs, of sweetcorn, or chopped peppers, or ham and bits of bacon. Cornbread is fine served with spicy food: chilli beans, spiced tomatoes, etc...</p><p>Spoonbread, which is really a souffle made with maize meal but no flour is extremely nice with spicy foods, bitterish greens and game casseroles.</p><p>Ingredients: 100g polenta; 500ml milk; 80g butter; 1 heaping tablespoon of sugar; good pinch of salt; 3 eggs, separated. Use a casserole or souffle dish, 15-18cm wide. Oil or butter this before use.</p><p>Method: Heat the milk, then stir in the polenta, salt and sugar. Stir the mixture until it’s thick then stir in the butter. Cool this slightly, then stir in the egg yolks. Preheat the oven to medium hot (gas6). Whip the egg whites until stiff, then fold them into the mixture. Pour into the casserole and bake it for 30-40 minutes, until it’s risen and browned. Serve immediately.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
