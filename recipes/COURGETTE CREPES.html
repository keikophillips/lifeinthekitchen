She was a NY Times reporter in Paris who collected recipes from ordinary good French restaurants in the 70s. I changed the recipe to suit my tastes and needs, using spring onion instead of garlic, adding cheese at the end to make a ‘main’, rather than a ‘side’, It looks good on the plate and is easy to prepare.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients (for two): 2 small courgettes; 2 spring onions; 2 eggs; 2 tblsp cream; 2 tblsp plain flour; 2 tblsp grated cheese (I used a mixture of parmesan and cheddar); 1 tblsp oil; 1 tblsp butter.</p><p></p><p>Method: Coarsely grate the courgettes, Salt them and place them in a colander, weighing them down and leave 10-15 minutes. Mince the spring onions. Then gather the grated courgettes into a cloth or J-cloth and squeeze them to rid them of excess fluid. Then combine them with the minced spring onions in a bowl. Mix with the eggs, cream and flour. Season them well. </p><p>Heat a large heavy bottomed frying pan. Add the oil, then the butter and when  the butter has completely melted, and it is all starting to sizzle, spoon in the mixture, spreading them out- say, two crepes per serving. When they are browned on the bottom, flip them over. Now spoon the grated cheese over them, baste them lightly with the oil and butter, and cover them. When the cheese has melted, they are ready to serve. </p></body></html>
