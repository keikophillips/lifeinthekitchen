<body><p>COURGETTES  >  COURGES,  A SWEET AND SOUR PICKLE</p><p></p><p>Here’s looking at a bumper harvest of courgettes! Inevitably some of these will metamorph into ‘grown up’ courges...more of a culinary challenge. In that spirit I am offering up my recipe for sweet and sour pickled marrow. If you have a glut of small courgettes, you can use this recipe; you’ll need less in weight of the littler courgettes, and less time salting and pressing them, but they will turn out equally delicious. I’ve been handing out this recipe for about 50 years, but people still get in touch asking for it- and I am not sure whether I ever put it in ‘The Quay’.</p><p>Of course, if you have an overgrown courgette, once you have grated it, salted it, combined it with some chopped onion and squeezed some of the moisture out (I use a ‘J-Cloth’), you can add a bit of flour and an egg to it all, for a rissole or vegetable cake.Still, here is that recipe for a truly marvellous pickle.</p><p>Ingredients: approximately 1kg of marrow, courge or slightly less in weight (600gs) courgettes;600g onions,thinly sliced; 2-3 red peppers, finely sliced; 1 chilli, de-cored, de-seeded and finely chopped; 2 teaspoons of salt; 300ml cider vinegar, 450g sugar; 1 level teaspoon turmeric; 1 teaspoon of pickling spice, or ½ teaspoons each of celery seed and mustard seeds. </p><p>Method: If using marrow or courge, peel it scoop out the seeds and soft pith in the middle. Finely slice it into small chunks. For courgettes,simply slice into small, pickle style chunks. Then combine with the sliced onions, peppers and chilli in a large bowl, sprinkling them with the salt. Mix it all well, then place this in a colander. Place a plate over them and something heavy on top of this plate,and then leave it all to drain, for at least an hour or two. Overnight is fine.</p><p>In a large saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the cider vinegar over gentle heat. Add the spices and turmeric, and bring it to the boil. Tip the vegetables into the saucepan and up the heat, bringing it all to a heavy boil. Cook for five minutes or so, until the marrow-courgette pieces look slightly translucent. Spoon this into clean wide-mouthed jars. Seal, Use within three or four months.</p><p>                                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
