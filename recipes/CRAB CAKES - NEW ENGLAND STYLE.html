Their standards are high, their stall impeccably clean. We’ve long needed a local supplier of ‘wet fish’, so I’m overjoyed about this bit of news.</p><p>To celebrate, here’s another recipe for Crab Cakes. I know that I’ve already given two in my little book of Crab Recipes, and the Louisiana Crab Cakes have appeared in this magazine. But this latest recipe, a New England version, strikes me as a worthy contender for a crab cake contest, if ever there were such a thing, and it’s very simple to concoct, so here goes, with a recipe which will give enough for 3-4 diners.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 2 Crabs (dressed); ½ clove of garlic, minced; ¼ medium onion, minced; a tablespoon of butter; 6-7 ‘Tuck’ style plain crackers, crumbled; 1 egg, lightly beaten; 2 teaspoons of lemon juice; 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire Sauce; a drop or two of Tabasco or other hot sauce; 1 tablespoon of cream (any sort); flour for coating and a little oil for frying.</p><p></p><p>Method: Cook the onion and garlic in ½ the butter for about two minutes (till they’re softened). Transfer to a bowl, then add the cracker crumbs and everything but the crabs, stirring it all well to blend. Last of all, add the crab, combine it all and leave to stand for 10-15 minutes. Then form into cakes.</p><p>Melt the remaining butter into a little oil in a frying pan. Coat the cakes lightly in a little flour then fry them until golden brown. Serve with lemon, and a little tartar sauce.</p><p></p><p>                                                         -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p>                                                                           </p></body></html>
