<body><p>CRAB OMELET, CHINESE STYLE</p><p></p><p>This is a delicious and quick meal. A large-ish crab will do for two, and a small crab will yield a sumptuous single serving. The omelet is a very thin wrap around the crab filling, and for two servings you’ll need two eggsl with more water. Accompanied by a few stir fried vegetables: thinly sliced onion, courgettes, mange-tout peas, regular peas, peppers….anything rapid and easy to cook, this makes for a quick and interesting meal.</p><p>Ingredients: 1 dressed crab; a walnut-sized piece of peeled ginger, grated; a finely chopped clove of garlic; the white bit of a spring onion, finely chopped; a small segment of chilli, well chopped;  a dessertspoon of sherry; a dessertspoon of soy sauce; a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil;  a dessertspoon of vegetable oil.  For the omelet: one egg lightly beaten with a tablespoon of water and the finely chopped green part of the spring onion; salt and pepper; a tablespoon of vegetable oil. l</p><p>Method: First of all, cook the crabmeat filling. Heat up the oil in a smallish frying pan and throw in the ginger, garlic, spring onion white  and the chilli. Then add the meat from the crab, all of it. Stir, then add the sherry and soy sauce. When well mixed and hot, turn off the heat and add the sesame oil. Pile this onto a plate, and wipe out the frying pan, then place it back on the fire, and add the next spoonful of oil. Add the egg mix, and rapidly move the pan so that it fills the whole pan. Then turn off the heat, and allow the omelet to finish cooking, which should be very rapid indeed. Pile the crabmeat filling on top of it, roll the omelet around the crab mixture when serving, as though it was a filled crepe.  If you are making this for two, you will have to divide the egg mixture into two portions and repeat the frying, but as this takes very little time indeed, it shouldn’t be too onerous.</p><p>                                                                            -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
