<html><body><p>A LIFE IN THE KITCHEN</p><p></p><p>It was a grubby old building, half caff, half fish shop, just off Wells Quay. We gazed at it wistfully everytime we drove there from our home six miles away, in order to buy crabs, shrimp or fish directly from the fishing boats on the quay.  We could see the elegant Georgian features disguised by too many layers of garish paint.  All it needed was care and attention to transform it into our heart’s desire, a proper little restaurant serving the wonderful food immediately available, including the freshly caught seafood from the quay.</p><p>At that time, 25 years ago, Wells Quay brimmed with activity. Double parked coasters bearing grain and fertilizer, fishing boats, pleasure craft, dinghies, children diving off the tallest ships, swimming between the boats. Onshore, men unloaded the coasters, the fishing smacks, selling off  crab, shrimps,and the byproducts  of their trips: dabs, sole, brill, skate and various other fish. Mixing with the bystanders were port officials, tourists.  The seabirds were ever present: ducks, swans, nosy gulls. And beyond the harbour the beautiful salt marshes gleamed. A glorious spectacle!</p><p>We loved it and longed to open a restaurant near this hive of activity. We knew we could do it. Bernard, my husband, had grown up in the famous family hotel his parents ran in Burnham Overy Staithe. We’d worked there until the hotel was taken over (and ruined) by another, unfriendly branch of the family. We’d done other things since then, including raising a family of four. Now our children were old enough not to require constant attention and I could work full time. And, I could cook. I’d won several national prizes, ran a successful catering business and had worked part time as a chef in a local restaurant, open only during the summer.</p><p>Working in that seasonal restaurant, I’d begun to yearn for our own business. During my sessions, we filled the place simply by offering dishes containing only fresh, local ingredients. These proved more popular than the ‘safe’ options of steak, sausage or battered fish.</p><p>Nearly a quarter century ago, these notions seemed radical. We were cautioned, when first approaching a bank, not to reveal these menu plans. Indeed. Bank managers saw little advantage to buying and running a restaurant  situated by the sea. Folly indeed to surround oneself with 180 degrees of water, we were told. Nevertheless, we did it- and now things have changed. Most eating places pay lip service to local and seasonal ingredients nowadays.</p><p>So, this is why I offer here, as a couple of tasters, recipes containing the most local and seasonal of ingredients for this time: crab and asparagus.</p><p> </p><p>CRAB SLICES</p><p></p><p>When we first started the restaurant, crabs were served in only one way: dressed, that is, the flesh extracted then returned to the shell, then served with a simple salad and possibly a little mayonnaise. Coming from the States, with a dad who had been brought up in Baltimore, I knew of the rich American repertoire of crab dishes. These slices can either serve as sandwiches, or  finely cut into dainty slices, make the most appetizing seasonal nibbles.</p><p>It must be made the day before it’s required, in order for the ingredients to blend and the bread to become fully infused with the crabby flavours. And, one roll will serve several people, if it’s cut fairly thinly, Set out on a tray, tittivated with parsley, or in season, swags of samphire – or perhaps some Japanese seaweed such as Hijiki or Arame, soaked, drained and then scattered, this is an elegant ‘amuse guele’. The amount of heat from the chilli sauce can be varied to suite your taste, but don’t eliminate it altogether as chilli and crab compliment each other. </p><p></p><p>Use long soft rolls, the longer the better. A genuine French baguette is a bit too crusty; what English bakers call ‘French sticks’, long, soft and slightly woolly are ideal.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: for 1 long French stick: 2  dressed crabs; 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise; 2 teaspoons of soy sauce; 3-4 teaspoons of sweet chilli sauce (Thai or Malaysian type sauce);a handful of chopper parsley.</p><p></p><p>Method: Cut the bread lengthwise in half just enough to hollow it out. Dig out the inner crumbs, leaving it looking like a thick double dugout. Pulverize the crumbs, then empty the crabmeat, white and brown into a bowl, adding the breadcrumbs. Combine well, then add  the mayonnaise, soy and chilli sauces. And finally, the parsley. Fill up one of the ‘dugouts’ and  cover with the other half.  Slice the loaf in half and place them side by side on  a clingfilm lined tray. Cover with more  clingfilm and then weigh them down with another tray on top. Find a place in your fridge to chill and store these overnight, When you’re ready to serve them, cut them neatly and thinly, garnish with parsley, samphire or seaweed, and then serve.</p><p></p><p>ASPARAGUS</p><p></p><p>The big treat of high spring, asparagus is widely grown in North Norfolk. Places I’ve bought from include Wiveton, Rudham, Binham, Bricham, Sharrington. Personally I prefer it simple. With a potato peeler I usually shave off a little at the bottom of each stalk, then stand it upright in the tallest saucepan I possess. If there isn’t much asparagus, I make a rough collar of tinfoil to put round it in order to prop it up. Then I pour  boiling water on, enough to cover the bottom two or three inches, cover the saucepan, and boil for 7-10 minutes until it’s done to your taste. The top tips soften rapidly; some prefer their stalks more ‘done’ than others. Serve with melted butter’ hollandaise, or mayonnaise.  It’s wonderful served alongside hard boiled eggs, with either mayonnaise, green sauce or vinaigrette.</p><p></p><p>A word of warning: if you are prone to attacks of gout, eating too much asparagus too often can bring on the agony. As in all things, moderation is advised.</p><p></p><p></p><p>                                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
