And nowadays, crab sandwiches have become popular, and even crab cakes are now available in many pubs and restaurants. But crab is also fine served up as part of a made up dish, such as noodle sheets layered with crabmeat and a cream sauce- a sort of crab lasagne, if you wish to put it that way. </p><p>I served this occasionally in our restaurant,years ago. Occasionally, if available, I peeled and thinly sliced puffball mushroom, substituting these sheets of fungi for sheets of pasta (I was secretly convinced that I was probably the only chef in the world serving this dish to the public – but – who knows?…). At any rate, a packet of lasagne sheet noodles and a couple of medium to largish dressed crabs are enough to make this delicious and homely pasta dish for four, so here goes!</p><p>Ingredients: One packet of Lasagne pasta; 2 dressed crabs; 1 tablespoon of sherry; 2 teaspoons of sweet chilli sauce; 3 teaspoons of fish sauce (Thai or Vietnamese sort);1 large tablespoon of flour; 50g butter; 550 ml milk; salt; pepper; nutmeg; cayenne; 100g of grated gruyere or emmental cheese.</p><p>Method: You need a smallish, deep dish, preferably rectangular or square for this.  And, it’s best to make this several hours in advance, leaving it to stand before baking, so that the pasta absorbs some of its liquid.</p><p>First of all, combine the crabmeat with the sherry, chilli sauce and fish sauce. Then make a cream sauce with the milk, flour and butter. Season this with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Now, butter your baking pan and ladle a very little sauce onto the bottom. Cover with a single layer of the pasta, then ladle a bit more sauce on top. Cover this with a thin layer of the crab mixture, then with the sauce. This time, sprinkle some of the grated cheese on the sauce. Now, more pasta, some crab, pasta, then the sauce. Finish with the cream sauce on top, together with the rest of the grated cheese. Dust it with a little cayenne, and leave it to stand (preferably in a fridge if the weather is not) for at least a couple of hours.  Leave it to stand for 15-20 minutes at room temperature before baking it in a medium oven for 35 minutes. Allow it to stand for 10 minutes before slicing into it. </p><p>This recipe can be varied by adding a little cooked white fish or some prawns or peeled shrimp to the crabmeat, along with a teaspoon or two of anchovy essence. And, for a really delicious addition, a savoury custard mixture of 200 ml milk and two or three egg yolks, well seasoned, can be poured over the whole dish (Moussaka-style), which will make the dish go further, besides providing a rich and sumptuous feast.</p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
