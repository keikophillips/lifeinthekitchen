They may have to be lightly sweetened, and if you wish, they can be just cooked through, if you need to save time (the crumble then, over the fruit, will take a relatively short time to cook in a hottish oven, as the fruit warms through.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients:100g coconut sugar, 100g granulated sugar; 200g se;f raising flour (or flour with 2 teaspoons of baking powder mixed through; 150g ground almonds, 50g porridge oats; 200g butter.</p><p></p><p>Method: Mix the dry ingredients all together. Chop in the butter, pastry-style. When it is mixed together, still granular, spread it over the fruit, and then bake it. If the fruit is not cooked, bake it in a moderate oven, for 30-40 minutes. If the fruit is cooked, bake in an oven at a higher temperature for 10-15 minutes.</p><p>                                                                                             -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
