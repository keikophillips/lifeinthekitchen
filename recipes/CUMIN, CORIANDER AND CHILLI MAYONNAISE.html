<body><p>A SHOW STOPPING SAUCE</p><p></p><p>The following sauce is fine as a dip for crisps and raw vegetables. But, it’s also a dream accompaniment for fishcakes, plain cooked fish or chicken. And it’s an absolute winner if you’re gathering together a ‘fridge meal’- that is leftover bits and bobs, vegetables, hard-boiled eggs – and want a nice sauce to accompany them.</p><p>It’s quick and easy to make; the mayonnaise called for can be of the shop bought variety. All the other ingredients are readily available. Any leftover sauce will store up to a week or so in a jar.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 3 heaping tablespoons of mayonnaise; 1 small clove of garlic, minced or grated; ½ chilli, deveined, deseeded and very finely minced; 1 level teaspoon of ground cumin; a handful of fresh coriander, very finely chopped; the juice of ½-1 fresh lime; 1 tablespoon of olive oil</p><p></p><p>Method: Combine all these ingredients. If you’ve the means to blitz them together (processor or blender of some sort), you can dispense with any of the mincing and chopping and simply mix them all together.  </p></body></html>
