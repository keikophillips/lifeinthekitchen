<body><p>CUPCAKES AND BROWNIES</p><p></p><p>I read a mini-rant in a national paper recently about the ‘demise’ of old fashioned British fairy cakes as opposed to the unstoppable rise of American-style cup cakes.</p><p>What nonsense!</p><p>Both are fine little cakes, made of the same basic sponge mixtures. Fairy cakes are baked in smaller, flatter tartlet tins, cupcakes baked in deeper muffin tins. Cupcakes are slightly bigger. The round, curvy top of fairy cake tops are sliced off finely then split into semi-circular ‘wings’ perched on top of the iced cakes (hence the name),</p><p>The slightly larger cupcakes can be iced and then stacked into a pyramid or large ‘mountain’; this is particularly popular as an alternative wedding or celebration cake.</p><p>Brownies, another American confection, are dense, squidgy cakes, baked in a large Swiss roll tin then sliced into bars or squares. Chocolate brownies are famous for containing lots of chocolate, butter and sugar, but not much flour. They’re all easy to assemble, but when baking they must be watched as if they are overbaked, they are dry and tough. </p><p>Now, for a simple recipe for Butterscotch Brownies, These little treasures are a cook’s gift. Made in a single saucepan, they don’t require much other equipment. This recipe is adaptable. If you wish, substitute cut up chocolate or chocolate drops for the walnuts. Or, if you wish to bake simple drop cookies, add three more tablespoons of Self Raising flour to the basic mixture then drop them in teaspoonsful onto a baking sheet lined with silicone paper.</p><p>Ingredients: 120g butter;200g dark muscovado sugar;120g light raw cane sugar; 230g Self Raising Flour mixed with 1tsp salt; 2 eggs; 2 tsp vanilla extract;80g chopped walnuts. A Swiss roll tin (33x23), greased and floured.</p><p>Method: Preheat oven to medium. Melt the butter then stir in the sugars until dissolved and starting to bubble. Remove pan from heat and leave for a minute or two. Then beat in the eggs and vanilla. Sift in the flour-salt mixture, stir well and add the nuts. Pour this mixture into the prepared tin then bake for 15-25 minutes- that is, until it’s browned and beginning to crust round the edges. Slice into squares or bars. Then store in an air tight container.</p><p>                                                                                       -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
