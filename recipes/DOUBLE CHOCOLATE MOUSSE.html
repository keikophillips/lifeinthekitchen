When we started out, I  tried several different recipes – I’m not a true ‘choco-holic’ and  most did not satisfy. I quickly discovered that unless the chocolate itself wasn’t dark, and of a high enough proportion (above 60%- but under75%) the result was disappointing. I finally worked out something which resembled a chocolate sort of pastry which I used to buy from  a little patisserie near Maubeuge-Mabillon when I studied in Paris. </p><p>It is basically two mousses, one set atop the other. The base is technically an omelette souffle, which rises and then sinks back. This forms the ‘crust’ with a richer topping of a mouse set with either real or ‘veggie’ gelatine – both work!  Not very much sugar goes into this pudding. This made it acceptable for many diabetics, and its absence of four made it ‘gluten-free’. But, it is very rich. Small servings are recommended. Make it in a large pizza or quiche dish with enough of an outer lip to contain it. It is made in two parts, the base is baked, and when that is cool the top is poured over it.</p><p>Total quantities required: 325g dark chocolate; 8 eggs; 75g sugar; 250ml double cream; 3 tablsp rum; 1 tsp vanilla essence; 1and1/2 teasp gelatine powder (the vegetarian version works well here); a little butter for greasing the dish; a little water.</p><p>For the base: Butter for greasing the dish; 125g chocolate; 4 eggs, the whites separated from the yolks; 75g sugar; 1 teasp vanilla.</p><p> Method: Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place it in a bowl with a tablespoon of water and melt it, either over simmering water, or in a microwave oven, removing it several times to stir it. When it is melted, stir in the egg yolks and the vanilla. Beat the egg whites until stiff, then gradually add the sugar. When this is all incorporated, fold the chocolate mixture into it and then pour this into the buttered baking dish. Bake it for 15-20 minutes in a medium oven until it isn’t liquid in the middle, but is just starting to colour more on the top. Remove from the oven, leaving it to cool, it will gradually sink while you prepare the topping.</p><p>For the topping: 1 and1/2 tsp gelatine powder; 200g dark chocolate; 4 eggs, whites separated from yolks; 3 tablsp rum.</p><p>Method: Dissolve the gelatine powder in a little bowl containing 2 tablesp water, and leave this to warm, very gently, either over a little simmering water or for a second or two in a microwave. You want this to just dissolve from powder into liquid. Chop and melt the remaining chocolate with another tablespoon of water and the rum. When the chocolate has just melted, stir in the gelatine, and then the egg yolks. Stir it well. Beat the egg whites until they stand in stiff peaks. Then whip the  cream.</p><p>Now, first fold the chocolate mixture into the cream. Last of all fold it all into then egg white mixture. Pour this onto the base, and leave it to stand an hour before refrigerating, for several hours before serving. </p><p>I know this does seem long, but it doesn’t take too much time if you have everything needed on hand. It can be served with yet more cream, if you dare!</p><p>                                                                                                       Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                           </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p></body></html>
