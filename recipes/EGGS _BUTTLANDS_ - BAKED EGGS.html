<body><p>EGGS BUTTLANDS</p><p></p><p>Here’s a recipe, invented when there were a couple of ordinary cooked leftovers in my fridge, plus milk, cheddar and a few eggs. While these ingredients may seem insignificant and ordinary, I want to assure my reader that this combination is nothing short of wonderful – very classy- which is why I’m calling it Eggs Buttlands. I’ve made it several times since for friends and it never fails to please. I’m not being too precise about the quantities of the main ingredients; wouldn’t it be silly to measure out most leftovers?</p><p></p><p>Ingredients (for 2): approximately 2 good dollops of mashed potato per person; cooked broccoli (if done from fresh, immerse your florets and sliced peeled stalks into rapidly boiling salt water for 4 minutes, then remove and strain under running cold water); 1 or 2 poached eggs per person and cheese-mustard sauce. </p><p>Ingredients for the sauce: 3ooml milk; 1 tablespoon of flour; 1 tablespoon of butter; 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard; 80-100g cheddar, grated.  </p><p></p><p>Method: Make the sauce Delia-fashion, that is, combine the cold milk, mustard, butter and flour in a saucepan and place over high heat. Stir constantly until it is thick and smooth, then remove from the heat. Add in most of the cheese, stirring constantly until smooth. Leave a little cheese aside to top the dish with before baking.</p><p></p><p>Now, for the final bit. Preheat  your oven to very hot. Butter a deepish ovenproof dish. Place your mashed potato on the bottom. Top with the cooked broccoli. Then, on top of this, carefully place your poached eggs. Coat the top of these with the cheese sauce, and scatter over the remaining bits of grated cheddar. Place your dish in your nicely heated oven and in about 10-12 minutes it should be bubbly, heated through, slightly brown on top and utterly delicious!</p><p>                                                                                             -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
