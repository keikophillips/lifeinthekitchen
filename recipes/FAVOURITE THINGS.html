Bernard’s parents ran a large hotel, overlooking the creek and salt marshes. His dad, George was in poor health; the family needed help. Bernard had been born and brought up there.</p><p>The Moorings Hotel, a large building facing on to the creek, was made up of the original Georgian dwelling and its adjoining outbuildings and barns facing the water of the tidal creek, directly across from its small island, alongside a large swimming pool (originally part of a jetty), surrounded seawards by romantically empty sea marshes across the creek, it was a beautifully situated building. It  had been converted into a hotel in the early 1920s by Bernard’s grandparents. His grandfather had quarrelled with his brothers and had been bought out of his share of the family distillery in London. He and his wife and large family had come up to Burnham Overy for a holiday, renting a houseboat on Scolt Head Island. While on a day trip to Burnham Market they had spotted notices for an auction sale at the Hoste Arms of the Moorings buildings and outbuildings. It was then called Staithe House and Grandpa bought it sight unseen, compete with a sitting tenant.</p><p>The sitting tenant died and his daughter moved away to become an Anglican nun.  Grandpa decided to convert it into a hotel. He hired local builders, told them what he wanted and the new hotel opened a few years later, His requirements included a central heating system and wash-hand-basins in each room. It was roughly modelled on the model of a mini country house. No locks on bedroom doors and plenty of old-fashioned service, from polished shoes (left outside bedroom doors each night), early morning teas (in bed) and food for any dogs accompanying their owners. As well as the swimming pool, there were marshes to explore, the boat to Scolt Head Island, and a tennis court. Indoors, there were several lunges, a billiard room (doubling up as a well-stocked library) and, of course, meal after meal in a large dining room directly facing the water.</p><p>Meal after meal. From early morning tea to a large cooked breakfast. Then, elevenses (coffee, tea and biscuits). A hearty lunch. Tea in the afternoon then a full meal in the evening. If lunchtime was skipped, sandwiches would be prepared, with cake, etc.</p><p>The hotel opened at the beginning of March and closed at the beginning of November. During the winter break, there were a few occasions when the hotel re-opened for the Sailing Club banquet and the like, but winter was given over to family holidays, followed, in the new year, by extensive spring cleaning and the making of the hotel’s own marmalade. This marmalade was made by a long process in which the fruit was sliced and soaked for several days in mater – every receptacle in the establishment would be filled with the mixture of fruit and water and be left to stand….I still make it that way and its making takes up a lot of space.</p><p></p><p>Even though there was this winter gap of time when it was not open, The Moorings was successful from its beginning. It was mostly full. Indeed, the Board of Trade, which collected statistics from all hotels, informed the family that this was one of the most successful establishments of its sort throughout the UK, in spite of its truncated year. The hotel didn’t serve alcohol, even though guests were welcome to bring it along. This probably had to do with the licensing laws of the time. In the early 1960’s, the laws changed and the hotel acquired a license to serve drinks. Profits climbed. Indeed, it was this increase in profit which inspired the ultimate hostile takeover of the hotel, and its demise.</p><p>At first the hotel employed professional cooks. But Bernard’s grandpa loathed the food they produced and Bernard’s grandmother took over in the kitchen, producing the sort of simple and homely food which was warmly welcomed by the guests. Bernard’s father, George, helped her in the kitchen. He had been in the Merchant Navy but he was happy to come out of it when he and his young wife Muriel moved to Norfolk. But, when war was declared the hotel shut. George went in to the navy immediately.</p><p>During the war the village was a ‘no go’ area and the large building was requisitioned to house soldiers. Furniture was stored away in a few rooms and the hotel became the headquarters of various troops. Old Grandpa Phillips died in 1943 and Bernard’s granny moved to her daughter’s hotel in Surrey. My mother-in-law Muriel was left inhabiting the half-converted barn directly adjoining the hotel, with her young family while her husband George was in the navy, participating in a very, very active war, on convoys and destroyer in Italy and Africa. He finally ended up as a beach master during the D-Day landings and was just getting kitted up to ship off to the Far East when the war finally ended.</p><p>Muriel, originally from London, was more or less marooned in Overy Staithe. Across the road from the hotel was a large field of glebe land which had provided all the vegetables and most of the fruit and soft fruit for the hotel. She had to keep this garden going as best as she could; this included keeping bees, chickens and pigs. Some of the meat had to go to the government, but she was expected to provide her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, living near London, with some of the meat and veggies as well, dispatching them by post (via the railway in Burnham). Throughout the war George sent letters talking about planting seasons, gardening hints, horticultural suggestions….Bernard remembered helping her rub salt into the shoulders of pigs in order to make hams. It hurt.</p><p>When the war ended, old Mrs Phillips felt that she was too old to carry on. The building had been completely wrecked by our occupying troops and there was no compensation. \so the hotel was put on the market. Ir failed to meet its £1000 reserve price. My father-in-law had returned from the war a weary and frail man. He decided that he would really like to join the river police. But, he was not tall enough. Someone recommended that he lie in bed for two weeks and with a bit of luck he would st retch that extra inch that he needed to qualify. Needless to say, this did not work. So, wearily he decided to restore the hotel, room by room, which he did, chiefly aided by Nelson Scoles, a local builder.</p><p>It reopened with just a few rooms in 1947, and gradually it was restored to its full size. Soon, it attracted the same sorts of clientele as before the war, and the same accolades it had previously qon. And, though there was rationing and many of the privations common to wartime and post war England, there was still that magnificent vegetable garden. There was local game. During the war the coastal waters had largely been out of bounds, so now, there plenty of fish and shellfish. Local beaches were gradually cleared of mines and once more, became accessible to the public. The hotel was able to revive its traditions of comfort and good food.</p><p>The hotel, like many of its sort, was a mini ‘Country House’;\an early morning tea in one’s bedroom was followed by a lavish breakfast, local bacon and sausages, mushrooms, bloaters (from Wells) accompanied porridge or dried cereals. Toast from Hewitts Bakery in Wells, Orange juice or grapefruit halves, the latter served ready-carved.  Then, tea or coffee.</p><p>Elevenses consisted or tea or coffee, with plain biscuits. But, soon enough the big brass gong would sound and lunch would be served to the large dining room directly overlooking the creek. There was always soup – largely an invention of my father-in-law made up, often, of leftovers from the previous day, picturesquely entitled: ‘Norfolk Soup’, ‘Romany Soup’, ‘Game Broth’….whatever came to mind when asked by Muriel ask she typed out the menu to be Roneo’d .There were also first courses...in season, Globe Artichoke, with butter or vinaigrette; Asparagus on Toast with Melted Butter; both grown in the garden. Sometimes, exotic then, Spaghetti with Tomato and Bacon Sauce. Sometimes Dressed Crab was on the menu. These arrived boiled but not dressed and everyone working in the hotel assembled in the kitchen to prepare them. My sister-in-law remembers a few occasions when there were not enough people on hand and she did about 30 crabs on her own. These were simply served, dressed, put back in their shells, along with mayonnaise and a sliced quarter of lemon.</p><p>There were cooked meat main dishes, and on Fridays, always a cooked fish dish like slices of halibut with cheese sauce. And of course, there were always cold options – yesterday’s roasts swerved with salad. Meals always had cooked fresh vegetables alongside potatoes. Puddings were often stewed fruit served with ‘Shapes’ of semolina, tapioca, cornflour – or hot teamed puddings. Evening puddings were a bit more elaborate.</p><p>Tea was simple but traditional. Thinly sliced bread. Dainty sandwiches of cucumber, tomato or egg. Plain home made cakes: sponges, rock cakes and a few bought biscuits. </p><p></p><p>And then, in almost no time, the big gong would sound again for the evening meal. The food at that time was slightly fancier. Glorious fish: turbot or sole, sometimes lemon sole or dabs- often treated simply, simply floured and sauteed, swerved with a slice of parsley butter or Maitre d’Hotel butter. There were often partridges, pheasants, duck and guinea fowl as well as chicken, all served with inventive sauces and accompaniments.</p><p>Like most cooks, Bernard’s dad had his own likes and dislikes. He loved vegetables but cooked them longer than they do nowadays- but the freshness and quality of them still shone through. He did not like garlic, though he did grow a couple of rows of it for a couple of years after the war when the family housed a strange French lady who insisted on having it for her health. He made friends with some of the American families who were stationed at nearby Sculthorpe air base and was intrigued with some of their American dishes. His inventiveness came out in his soups and sauces. This was noticed in the earliest years of ‘The Good Food Guide’ for it was in the second edition that the Moorings appeared and continued to appear until our family left the hotel.</p><p>Most of the main ingredients were fully traceable in origin. Meat came from Barkers, the Burnham Market butcher. On Sundays, there was a huge roast of ribs of beef, roasted on the bone. Dad had been to a ‘carving school’  and was adept at serving out roasts, as was his eldest sister who had sold her hotel in Surrey and joined him in the kitchen during the later years of the hotel. She was a good baker and made meringues last thing at night in a slowly cooling electric oven which had been used during the main supper meal.</p><p>When the man who smoked bloaters in Wells retired, Bernard went to join him for a few days in order to learn how they were done. He and his dad converted an outdoors loo up in the garden into a smoke house, which they ysed. Otherwise fish came from Mr Farrow in Burnham, He delivered large turbot, brill, cod and halibut as well as sole and dabs.</p><p>Guinea fowl, partridges and pheasants came from Pettits of Reedham who were also hotl customers. Mrs Pettit made decorations from the feathers of their birds. Other produce was delivered by carious wholesalers, milk coming through the local dairy in Burnham, who also made and delivered a delicious cream cheese. Later on, I mixed this with various herbs, producing a sort of Hungarian style Liptauer cheese spread.</p><p>Ice cream, made by a prize-winning Cambridge dairy came by train; it was picked up in Hunstanton. My father-in-law also bought whole Stilton cheese, often choosing ones which had won prizes in various county shows (the Royal, the Royal Norfolk and the East of England shows). He read about them in the papers and telephones the makers. They were beautifully served in a splendid large Wedgwood Stilton dish, complete with a special knife. Other British cheese also were served.</p><p></p><p>Wholesalers, including purveyors of fancy stuff like anchovies or fancy tinned fruits, came to the hotel, as did the equivalent of a modern cash-and-carry wholesale firm. There were no supermarkets then. Indeed, when we returned to England after living in America, that super markets might be a good idea, he replied that they would never go down well in England, particularly in Norfolk!</p><p>When we came to the hotel in 1965, the hotel had only recently gained their liquor license. Bernard took over this, reading book after book about wines before they started their wine cellar in a part of the outbuilding in back of one of the garages. We bought most of our wines from Peatling and Cawdrons, storing some of them in their cellars in the shop in Wells, at the Globe.  Bernard and his dad also bought consigns of wine from some of the auction sales in London. They constructed asmall bar in one of the lounges that immediately led on o the dining room and I worked there before supper time, trying my best to serve occasional cocktails (hastily looking them up in a little booklet) as well as serving sherry and pre-dinner aperitif style wines.</p><p>We found  a house to live in on Friars Lane in Burnham Norton in the summer of 1966 and moved there on the day that England won the World Cup. Bernard cycled to work from our home and I stayed at home with out very young children. Occasionally I made a few American-style puddings for the hotel restaurant, but I was very busy indeed with the family and our large (one acre) garden. And it was then that me formation as a cook re-commenced.</p><p>What was available in local shops was limited. No garlic, Nor peppers or aubergines. No chillies, yogurt, skimmed milk, soured cream. No undyed smoked haddock. No fresh or frozen orange juice. Privations and the frugality of war had diminished and hardened the tastes of the general population, And, even in a climate which is able to produce fresh vegetables virtually all year round the availability of many of them was narrow. And, there were few native traditions for preserving. For instance,  there is no local version of pickling or preserving cabbages in order to make sauerkraut. </p><p>Here, I think that I must familiarize you with a bit of my own background. I was born and raised in the USA. My parents were both immigrants from Russia, with families who regarded food simply as fuel. Their diet were heavily plant based and designed to outlast hardship. Porridge and hot cereal in the morning. Plenty of hearty vegetable soup, summer and winter, cold and hot. Bread designed to last for longer than a week. Pickled, cured, smoked and dried meat or fish. Mushrooms, fresh or dried – all of these the mainstays of a Slavic diet.</p><p>Luckily, when we moved to Burnham, we had, four times a week, deliveries of old-fashioned good bread from Grooms. I could not abide the widely available fluffy, tasteless commercial bread found in many homes and shops.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I missed many of the mainstays of my New York American diet, particularly various fermented milk products. Why couldn’t I buy yogurt, or soured cream, or buttermilk? Then, during my first year of Living in Burnham Norton, I caught hepatitis. Because I could not digest fat, I wanted skimmed milk. Not available then, except in dried and powdered, imported from France, One early morning, on the radio, we heard farmers complaining  that they just could not sell enough milk.We wrote, suggesting that they try selling skimmed milk. There was a quick reply – there was no demand! When we asked about yogurt the answer was the same. We sent away for yogurt culture and began making our own…</p><p>The ethos behind the cuisine at the hotel was one of luxury. Standards were high, and well appreciated. The staff at the hotel enjoyed their own good meals, though thy insisted on having chips rather than potatoes cooked in any other way.  In our newly acquired house, I got to know our neighbours and grdually made friends with many local people. And I became familiar with their daily food habits. We all used a local  travelling butcher (from South Creake) who called once a week. When I asked him what he sold most of, he pointed to the stacks of trays in his little van, each containing ‘pig’s fry’ - a mixture of offal, liver, kidnes. This was often the sole fresh meat meal each week. This was often supplemented by tinned meat – Spam and Fray Bentos pies and some tinned fish, with occasional fish and chips which had its own van. Tinned fruit and some powdered ready-to-mix puddings were also popular. Pastries included sausage rolls and Norfolk Shortcakes, the latter a pastry made with lard, containing dots of more lard, dried fruit and sugar. Meals were accompanied with fruit squashes, Industrian sauces and jam was on hand, as well as that squidgy, fluffy bread. </p><p>Many families prepared a packed lunch for their children, although the school cooks prepared decent, tasty and nutritious meals for the children. \the school cook’s sensible and tasty ways with vegetables (‘I just show the cabbage t the hot water’, she explained) were rejected. And, when my children had a birthday party and invited their classmates, I would receive heartfelt pleas to please provide sandwiches made with ‘shoppy’ bread and jam, with plenty of fruit squash as an accompaniment.</p><p>Nevertheless, many local families had members who were ardent wild fowler and pigeon, rabbit,and hare appeared on their tables.Of course, dubiously obtained pheasant, partridges and other game also appeared on their tables. Poaching then was a reasonable bread-winner, as local trains which accessed London could quickly whisk away their booty to London. Nowadays, with pheasants available at such low prices, this seems unimaginable. Then, the newspaper printed weekly reports of poachers up before the magistrate.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There were also those who gathered mussels, samphire and cockles. Over the years, there had been may disagreements between authorities administering the marshes and coasts over the gathering of these things. The uneasy balance between these parties still persist even though they all have vested interests in preserving this coastal area.</p><p>As the growing of vegetable crops became more industrialized, with picking and packing automated over the years, the farming population diminished. There were still gangs of fruit pickers, harvesting some soft fruit and on some farms, apples, pears, and asparagus. Some of the pickers were recruited from groups of travellers. Others were local housewives, and their gangmaster strutted around like cockerels….</p><p>The local diet was supplements with strong seasonings like mustard and horseradish. Mustard was grown locally and sold to Colmans of Norwich who dried and powdered it, selling it in small tins. Horseradish, a common and deep rooted ‘weed’ was grated before being combined with vinefar sugar and cream. There were a few horseradish ‘king’ who would bring their whole families to the coast to dig for horseradish during the winter months, Finely grated, and combined with vinegar, sugar and cream it was often available in small jars on stands along the roads between Lynn and Wisbech,  Parsley and mint were the most commonly used garden herbs. Saffron, which historically had been common in these parts, was largely unknown and has only recently been revived though the offices of Dr Sally Francis, a Burnham Norton girl. </p><p>It was not until the mid to late 70s that different products became available. Appearing occasionally were exotic vegetables – aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chillies. More fruit: mangoes and lychees. It is hard to imagine that salami and brie cheese were so exotic that it meant a drive to Norwich in order to obtain them. When the first Leftleys, a delicatessen, opened up on top of Wells High Street, it seemed a boon and delight to be able to buy these things locally.</p><p>The shallow waters of our coast had been a great source of fishing for locals. Traditionally, dabs (a sort of flounder) were caught in the shallow creeks by walking around in the water, bearing a long rake-like fork with sharp prongs at the ends, which stabbed and speared the fish as they swam in the shallows. Severely trimmed, then floured and fried, these were a popular local meal. Other fishing methods included laying out nets along the beaches, which brought in sea trout, salmon, bass and mullet. Local fishermen also netted mackerel, dogfish, and occasionally, brill and sole. Most of these fish, and their fishermen, have long disappeared, and local trawlers bring in crabs, lobster, shrimp, and if they go out far enough, whelks.</p><p></p><p></p><p>   </p><p> </p></body></html>
