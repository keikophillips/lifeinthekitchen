<body><p>FISH PIE  </p><p></p><p>This is one of the great English dishes. It’s not suitable for a single or pair of diners, unless there is a handy freezer nearby. It has  a few procedures which take a bit of time, though with a certain amount of planning it doesn’t really take that long, and can certainly be prepared well in advance. But, for a real crowd pleaser, this certainly takes pride of place.</p><p>Ingredients: (for 4)- 1 small amount of salmon fillet;smallish amounts of smoked haddock fillet; a small fillet of haddock, cod or other white fish;l a handful of cooked prawns; optional- more fish, mussels, clams, scallops,etc.; mushrooms, capers, and- optional- hard boiled eggs; peas, carrots. Potatoes- a good sized potato per serving; 3 tablespoons of cream; 600ml milk; 1 egg; butter; flour; 2 bay leaves; paprika; nutmeg; salt and pepper; Thai fish sauce; Marsala wine (or sweet sherry); breadcrumbs; optional – a little grated parmesan cheese.</p><p>Method: First of all, place the smoked haddock in a smallish shallow baking dish and cover it with 200 ml of the milk and a bay leaf, Place a sheet of foil on the dish and bake the fish in a moderate oven for 10 minutes, until the skin of the fish lifts easily off the carcass. Pour the milk into a smallish saucepan, discard the bay leaf and the skin of the fish and then cut it into bite sized pieces, placing them in a bowl. Wrap the salmon with the piece of foil, place it in the oven for 5 minutes, then remove whatever skin is on that fillet. Cut it into pieces, and add it to the bowl containing the haddock. Do the same for the white fish (cod or haddock) joining them up with the other pieces of fish. Then add the prawns- and any other bits of fish or shellfish. Slice and fry the mushrooms in a little butter, then add them to the mixture, along with a handful of capers. Cover the peeled, chopped potatoes with cold water, a teaspoon of salt, and the remaining bay leaf, bring to the boil and cook until the potatoes are really tender. While they are cooking, make a thick bechamel sauce with butter (2 tablespoons, flour 2 tablespoons, the milk from the smoked haddock and 400 ml of the remaining milk. This should be thick and unctuous. Season with the fish sauce, the Marsala and salt and pepper. Add the cream to this mixture. Allow this to cool, covering the cooking pot so that no skin is formed,</p><p>When the potatoes are coo0ked drain them and discard the bay leaf. Mash them well, then season with salt, pepper and plenty of grated nutmeg. Add the remaining milk (200 ml) and a little melted butter. Beat in the egg. They should be smooth and easy to spread. You may have to add a little milk here, depending upon the very nature of the potatoes themselves.</p><p>Now, butter a baking dish. Mix the cooled bechamel with the fish and place this at the bottom of your baking dish. If you wish to add hard boiled egg bits or peas, etc, now is the time. Smooth this quickly, then dollop on the mashed potatoes. Smooth these till they are level, and decorate with stripes formed with the times of a fork. Cover it with breadcrumbs, a few dots of butter, salt, pepper and paprika, and – if you wish- some grated parmesan cheese.</p><p>When you are ready, bake this in a moderate oven for at least 30 minutes. Allow it to stand for about 10 minutes before serving.</p><p>                                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p><p> </p></body></html>
