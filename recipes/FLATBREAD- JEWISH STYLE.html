A different version of pizza or foccaccio, the dough contains less fat.It’s simple to make, and is really delicious, a perfect picnic dish. I make mine with red onions. You can use either poppy seeds or nigella seeds (also known as Kalonji, available in Indian groceries).</p><p>It takes time to rise, but there is no hard work involved.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 460g strong flour; 2 teaspoons sugar; 7g (one packet) yeast; 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil; 2 and ½ teaspoons of salt; 2 medium onions (red or white) finely sliced; 1 small egg, mixed with a dessertspoon of water; 1-2 teaspoons poppy or nigella seeds; a teacup of warm water.</p><p></p><p>Method: Weigh out the flour. In a small combine a tablespoon of it with the sugar and the yeast, and  add the warm water. Stir well and leave it until it starts to foam \(10-15 minutes). Then combine this with the rest of the flour,half the salt and a tablespoon of the oil, Knead these together, adding, if necessary, a little more water. Knead this all together for about 7 minutes, when you should have a smooth dough. Place this in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it round, cover with some film and leave it to rise for a couple of hours. Meanwhile, gently fry the chopped onions with the rest of the salt, in the remaining oil, until they are soft and transparent. Then set them aside.</p><p>When the dough has doubled, roll it out as thinly as possible, or stretch it with your fingers, until it covers one or two flat trays. With a fork, prick the dough all over, leaving a little border around the sides. Cover it loosely and leave it to rise for a half hour in a warm place.</p><p>Now, mix the egg with the dessertspoon of water and brush this onto the dough, avoiding the unpricked edges. Scatter the onions over this, then the poppy or nigella seeds, and leave it to rise for 10 minutes. Bake it in a hot oven for 30 minutes or so, then remove it and cool on a rack.  Eat  hot, warm or cold.</p><p></p><p>                                                               -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
