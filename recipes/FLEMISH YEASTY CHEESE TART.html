Even though it is made with a rich dough and the yeast contained within the tart means that it takes a little time to realize, it is so simple in execution that it is well worth it. The recipe originally came from Jane Grigson’s French Regional Cookery, but it has been amended and adopted somewhat through the years.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: For the yeast dough: 250g flour; 1 pkt dried instant yeast (approx 6 gms, or you might try a little block of fresh yeast); 125dl lukewarm milk; 1 teaspoon salt; 2 eggs; 100g softened butter. For the topping: 180-250g strong soft (oozer) cheese,i.e. maroilles, reblochon, livarot, or well matured camembert; 30g butter; 1 egg and 1 egg yolk; 125 cream or crème fraiche; salt, pepper and grated nutmeg.</p><p></p><p>Method: Combine the flour and yeast with the salt, milk and eggs in a food processor or mixer with a dough hook.Beat well till the dough is soft and elastic and then add in the softened butter. Transfer this dough to an oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm. Leave it to rise until doubled (approximately 2 hours in a warmish place). </p><p>Then, knead the dough briefly (to knock out the air). Place it into a buttered 23cm (9 inch) pie pan, flattening it so that it lines the entire pan. </p><p></p><p>Now for the filling. Scrape most of the mould off the cheese. Slice it thinly and place this over the yeast dough. Dot with the butter. Beat the egg and egg yolk with the cream, seasoning it with a very little salt, some pepper and grated nutmeg. Pour this over the cheese and leave it to rise for 15-30 minutes (until it has visibly risen). </p><p>Bake it in a hot (200c) oven for 45-55 minutes, until the filling is browned and the pastry seems crisp around the edges.</p><p>Slice into fine wedges, serve, and watch it disappear!</p></body></html>
