It’s fine using blueberries, summer soft fruits or, at this time of the year, apples and blackberries.</p><p>It’s best made in the bowls you’re going to eat it in- use a smallish sort of ceareal or small soup bowl which is ovenproof.</p><p>For each single portion of fruit you need a teaspoon of sugar, a drop or two of lemon juice and a tiny pinch of cornflour. Mix these with the prepared fruit {chunks of peeled apple with some blackberries, say). Distribute it into the bowl(s). Add a dessertspoon of water per portion.</p><p>For each portion of topping you need 20 grams of softened butter and 20 grams of light brown sugar. If you like, you can also add a drop or two of vanilla essence. Cream these together. You can use a mixer, wooden spoon, or if it’s for one or two you can simply use your clean and warm hand. Into this stir 30 grams of self-raising flour. Now, pat this mixture into disks (one for each portion) an d place it in the bowl on top of the sides, sealing it in on the sides.</p><p>Bake in a hot oven for 10-15 minutes, until it’s slightly more browned and the fruit is starting to bubble up well. Lovely served hot, with cream, but nice when cool as well.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p>                                                      </p></body></html>
