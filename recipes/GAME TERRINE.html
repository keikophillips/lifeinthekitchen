<html><body><p>GAME TERRINE</p><p></p><p>A combination of various recipes, this one was used, time after time, in my restaurant. If you have the minced venison, you can use any other bits of game in it, to lend contrast and texture as well as taste. As for the pistachios, they are a little bit of additional colour without a very strong taste, and could be omitted – though I think they add to the look.</p><p>The recipe is easy to assemble, once you have got it all together, and after cooking and cooling, can be frozen for up to a month—but it  will last up to a week or so, just in the fridge.</p><p></p><p>INGREDIENTS: For the actual terrine: 500g minced venison; 500g minced pork; 250g rindless smoked streaky bacon; 6 rashers of unsmoked streaky bacon; 100g shelled pistachios; 175ml white wine or vermouth or dry strong cider; 25 ml brandy; the seasonings: 2 tasp crushed juniper berries; ½  tsp ground allspice; ½ tsp powdered mace; ½ tsp ground coriander; 1 tsp chopped thyme; 2 tsp ground black pepper; 2 tsp salt. For the gamey ‘bits’: pigeon breasts, chunks of pheasant or partridge meat; rabbit; all cut into bite sized chunks, covered with a bit of ground pepper and a tablespoon or two of brandy and soaked for at least a couple of hours.</p><p></p><p>METHOD: In a large bowl, combine the minced venison and pork. Slice the smoky streaky bacon into small strips and add them and the pistachios into the mixture. Season with the herbs and spices, salt and pepper and add the wine and brandy. Mix well, using your hands.</p><p>Line a large bread tin with three of the slices of unsmoked bacon. Then put half of the minced mixture into the tin. Add the separate gamey bits, then cover with the remaining minced mixture. Cover this with the remaining slices of streaky unsmoked bacon. If you wish, scatter a few bay leaves on top of this, but it isn’t strictly necessary.</p><p>Now, wrap the tin well in a double layer of foil. Put the tin into a roasting tin, pour enough boiling water into the tin to come nearly halfway up the side of the bread tin, and bake in a medium hot oven for 1and ¼  to 1 and ½ hours. To test for done-ness, stick a sharp knife into the pate and if it isn’t red, you’re okay.</p><p>Leave it to cool, placing another tin on top of it, weighted down with a few tins or bottles. This is just to make the pate that little bit more dense and easy to slice; it isn’t strictly necessary. Chill overnight before emptying it out of the tin. Serve with small gherkins.</p><p></p><p>                                -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
