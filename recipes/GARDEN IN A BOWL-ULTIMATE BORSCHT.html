<body><p>GARDEN IN A BOWL</p><p></p><p>In one of Martin Cruz Smith’s excellent detective stories set in Russia, his melancholy hero Renko describes a vegetable plot near Chernobyl, in Ukraine. Despite the obvious danger from radiation, it is luxuriant, verdant, productive, with potatoes, beetroot, carrots, turnips, onions,etc—Russia on a plate, he concludes.</p><p>He refers, I think, to that great soup which almost might be eaten on a plate, Borscht. There are many, many different versions eaten thought the Slavic lands. Substantial ones with meat and bones, light and summery ones with just a few ingredients served mainly chilled, versions made with fermented beet juice starters, and the one that I give you now, a substantial all vegetable soup which was probably a mainstay of Lent or other fasting periods. This particular soup is fine served cold, but it is always comforting if there is a bit of wind and chill about. </p><p>The list of ingredients, sounding a bit like a vegetable grower’s catalogue, may seem a bit intimidating. Made with so many different vegetables the resulting taste is surprisingly complex and sophisticated. Its fine flavour, redolent of the productive allotment or plot, makes this one of my favourite recipes. It’s a comfort to the very ill and not ill at all alike.</p><p>I know that the quantity produced by making my version may seem awesome. But, the soup will last for longer than a week, will freeze well (use milk containers to store it) and is a really fine present for a friend. You may have to borrow or resurrect a large enough saucepan to contain it all. But it’s worth it!</p><p>Warning: there is an awful lot of cleaning, peeling and chopping required at the beginning. Sadly, there are no shortcuts, but apart from the prep, not much is required in terms of time, until the end, when you will need a stick blender, processor, or regular blender in order to amalgamate all the bits and produce the velvety, richly coloured  mixture which is wonderful, reheated gently and served with a\ dollop of soured cream, Greek yogurt or crème fraiche. </p><p></p><p>Ingredients: a bunch of beetroot, complete with the leaves and stems. The roots must be peeled, the leaves and stems cleaned and chopped;a very large onion, chopped; 1 leek, chopped;1 large potato, peeled and chopped; 1 clove of garlic, chopped; a large carrot, peeled and chopped; a turnip, peeled and chopped ;2 blades of celery, chopped; a tin of tomatoes; optional- a few chopped mushrooms; a green or red pepper, chopped; 1 tablespoon of cooking oil; 1-2 tablespoons of butter; a cooking apple, peeled and chopped; 3 tablespoons of sugar; the juice of 1 lemon; 2 tablespoons of cider vinegar; parsley stalks (as many as you have); a small pinch of cumin; either a handful of fresh dill or a teaspoon of freeze-dried dill;1 tablespoon of vegetable stock powder; salt, pepper and cayenne.</p><p></p><p>Method: In a large saucepan, heat the butter and oil and saute the onion until it softens. Now add the chopped  beetroots, together with the garlic and potato. Cover the pan and cook it on a gentle heat for around 10 minutes, stirring at least once. Then add in the garlic, the chopped beetroot greens and stems, the carrot, turnip, celery, apple, tomatoes, and if available, the mushrooms and pepper, together with the pinch of cumin. Cover and cook for another 10 minutes. Then, add the parsley stalks, sugar, lemon juice, cider vinegar, dill and either vegetable stock or vegetable stock powder and enough water to cover the ingredients well. Cover the pot and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the toughest vegetable (the beetroot) is tender. Then remove the pot from the heat and allow it to cool slightly before pulverizing the mixture with either a stick blender or dolloping it into the processor. </p><p>Correct the seasoning, adding salt, pepper and cayenne, and if necessary, either sugar or cider vinegar (I particularly recommend the Whin Hill cider vinegar). Reheat and serve with the soured cream, plenty of bread and butter.</p><p></p></body></html>
