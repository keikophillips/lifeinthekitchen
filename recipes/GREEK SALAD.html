<html><body><p>GREEK SALAD</p><p></p><p>This is often perfunctory – a very simple salad, swiftly prepared. But, with very little more attention, it’s a really fine starter or ‘side’.</p><p>Ingredients, for 3-4: Several sorts of salad leaves: red, oak leaf, cos, little gem, curly leaf, perhaps a smattering of rocket – counting upon a couple of handfuls per serving, well washed and dried and if large of leaf,torn into serving sized bits; 1 cucumber, peeled and cut into smallish chunks; 12-15 small or cherry tomatoes, sliced into halves; 2 spring onions, finely sliced; 2 red peppers, de-skinned (either grill them or use ones from a jar); 12-15 stoned and halves black olives; 2 teaspoons of drained capers; 100g feta cheese, cut into cubes; a handful of parsley, finely chopped and – if available, a little chopped fresh marjoram and fennel. For the dressing: 1 clove of garlic, grated or minced and immersed into 4-5 tblsp olive oil and 1-2 tblsp of lemon juice.</p><p>Method: First of all prepare the lettuce and place it in a large bowl. Add the spring onions and mix well. Combine the cucumber chunks with the sliced tomatoes. Salt them lightly and leave them to drain in a colander for 10-15 minutes. Slice the red peppers and add them to the lettuce, along with the olives and capers. Then add the tomato-cucumber mixture, the feta cheese and the chopped herbs. Last of all, combine the lemon juice with the garlic impregnated olive oil, a little black pepper and a very small amount of salt. When you are ready, toss it and serve it, accompanied with bread.</p><p>                                                                          Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
