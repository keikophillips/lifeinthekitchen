<html><body><p>GREEN SAUCE</p><p></p><p>Sometimes a sauce will overwhelm the rest of a dish, swamping the main ingredients it’s supposed to enhance. But, here is a sauce, a vinaigrette, which will transform the most mundane item: a steamed or poached piece of chicken or fish, say. It can be used with tinned fish and store cupboard salad ingredients (gherkins, peeled roasted peppers, capers, olives) to make a version of Salad Nicoise. This sauce will last in a covered jar, refrigerated, for at least 10 days.</p><p>Even though it contains anchovies, don’t be put off by the idea of combining this sauce with chicken (or even pheasant); the combination works out in effect as much more than the whole of the contents!</p><p>Ingredients: 2 cloves of garlic; 2 small shallots; a drained tablespoon of capers; 3-4 anchovies; 3-4 small (cocktail style) gherkins; 1 chilli, de-seeded and de-veined; a few stoned black olives; a good handful of fresh parsley; 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar; 6-7 tablespoons of olive oil; freshly ground black pepper.</p><p>Method: Chop the garlic, parsley, shallots, anchovies, gherkins, chilli and olives until they’re as fine as you can achieve. Place them in a jug and mix in the vinegar. Gradually whisk in the olive oil, then season with the black pepper.</p><p>Use a tablespoon of this on steamed fish or chicken. Or, combine it with cold or tinned fish, some green beans, tomatoes and peppers for a Salad Nicoise. You can also add hard boiled eggs to this.</p><p>The Nicoise mixture can be used as a sandwich filling as well, using squashy bread and weighting it down in the fridge overnight. </p><p>                                                                          -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
