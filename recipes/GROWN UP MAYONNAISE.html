<html><body><p>GROWN UP MAYO!</p><p></p><p>When he was a little boy, my oldest son, now over 50, was a champion fussy eater. Now married to a Japanese woman who is a very fine cook, he enjoys almost every thing he obstinately rejected when a child. Now, influenced by her excellent cooking, the rest of our family has warmed to the Japanese condiments and seasoning she uses. That is why this column is a hymn to Miso, a common fermented soya product which is used to season soups, sauces, ordinary dishes. There are many sorts – and colours- of Miso. Many are available in delis and supermarkets in pricey little jars, but they can be found in oriental groceries as well as on specialist market stalls. White Miso – not really white, more of a greyish colour- has become my new best friend. Used first as an additional seasoning in leftover stir-fries, and to flavour vegetable water for soup, I’ve now branched out. A little bit, say, a heaping teaspoon full, added to about half a cup of mayonnaise (store-bought), with an additional teaspoon of sweet chilli sauce (the Thai type)  makes what I call ‘Grown Up Mayo’. Mixed well together with either a fork or whisked, and serve it with all manner of things: hard-boiled eggs, cold cooked veggies, potatoes, fish and chips….It is ultra delicious..
