Too fast!”</p><p>“Cars parking anywhere and everywhere. Blocking off entrances. On double yellow lines!”</p><p>“Where are the traffic wardens?”</p><p>“Rude people!” “Pushy people!”</p><p>“They’re all looking for second homes. Where will our families live?”</p><p>“Supermarket shelves emptied. Small cartons of milk a prized rarity!”</p><p></p><p>I could go on. Complaints abound. We grizzle amongst ourselves. We know that we need more houses for our local population but do not agree where they will be sited. Must we give up the lovely pastureland which we see when we enter the town from the ‘Dry’ road? These scraps of meadow with their grazing horse are a throwback to a gentler past- the very past of our dinky picturesque beach railway. Will that disappear?</p><p>We all know that ‘social’ housing is needed. But where will it go? ‘Affordable’ housing is just too expensive and local builders who obtained permission for reasonably priced housing in the first place have had slippery ways of not building enough of them...And, our genuine abandoned slum, round Maryland is untouched, unchanged.</p><p>Yes, we live on troubled times. But in the past we have united often enough to see off some monstrosities and have fought for some great things. Our town council is a model body of citizens battling their corners in civilized ways, often uniting to defeat silly proposals (not that North Norfolk Council always pays attention). </p><p>We must try to listen to each other, take a longer view of our future and try to grow our town sensibly. Grumpiness will not get us anywhere.</p><p>                                                                         </p><p>                                                                                          -Carla Phillips  </p></body></html>
