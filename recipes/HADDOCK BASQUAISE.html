<body><p>HADDOCK BASQUAISE</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In our restaurant. Outside of the busy months, we used to have occasional ‘special’ evenings, when we would not serve our regular dishes, but would concentrate on the food and wine of a specific area. This recipe found in a French paperback: La Cuisine de A a` Z: Sud-Ouest, Perigord, was an instant hit. Several customers requested that we put this on our regular menu, which we did, from then on.</p><p></p><p>Smoked haddock is as popular in France as it is here- it is called ‘Haddock’, as if there were no other sort. And, since the delicious smoked haddock from Cley Smokehouse is now regularly available in Wells, and fresh local tomatoes are at their most plentiful and luscious, this recipe seems appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients (for 2): 400g smoked haddock; 50ml milk; 50ml water; 1 largish onion, finely sliced; 120g ripe tomatoes; 1 small clove of garlic,minced; 80g olives, stoned and roughly chopped; 10g butter; 2 tablespoons of olive oil; a bay leaf; handful of parsley, chopped; a little fresh chopped marjoram or a good dash of dried oregano; salt, pepper and cayenne</p><p></p><p>Method: Put the milk and water into a saucepan large enough to contain the fish and bring it to the boil.</p><p>Place the fish fillets in it, lower the heat and gently poach the fish for 10-15 minutes, until the fish has changed colour and is easy to skin. This process can also be done in a microwave.</p><p>Meanwhile, peel the tomatoes by immersing them briefly in rapidly boiling water, then skinning them. Squeeze them gently to remove the seeds, then chop them very roughly. In the wintertime, you can use a very small tin of chopped tomatoes. </p><p>Saute the sliced onion in the little bit of butter gently, until it is a blondish, straw sort of colour. Then add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, parsley, marjoram or oregano, bay leaf, the pepper and cayenne. Cook for about 7-10 minutes; the sauce should have thickened.</p><p>Remove the fish from the liquid, skin it, remove any bones if present, then break it into smallish segments. Add the olives and olive oil, and mix it gently to combine.Finally, add the sauce to the fish-olive mixture, then taste for seasoning. This is one recipe where you don’t want to add salt too early on, as there is a fair amount of salt in the smoked fish as well as the olives. Reheat the mixture very gently before serving. It’s great with green beans of any sort as well as mash.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
