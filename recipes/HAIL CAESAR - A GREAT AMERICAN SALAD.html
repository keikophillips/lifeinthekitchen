<body><p>HAIL CAESAR – A GREAT AMERICAN SALAD</p><p></p><p>I thought that I had already given this recipe, but, combing my files, I was unable to resurrect this one, so am giving it again. Like many Yanks, I am slightly riled when I see what  strange combinations  are presented in the name of relatively simple but tasty American dishes – and this one is so nice that it seems a shame to see it spoiled so frequently. The recipe given for the dressing is enough to serve it several times .</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: Romaine or Cos Lettuce (adding other sorts is not necessary). Croutons (made by tossing small chunks of bread in a very little olive oil, then spreading them out on a baking tray – then seasoning them with salt, pepper and a few sprinkles of thyme, then baging them until they are lightly browned and crisp.) The dressing: 200ml mayonnaise; 1 anchovy or a teaspoon of anchovy paste; 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce; 2 tablespoons of lemon juice; 1 crushed clove of garlic; 40g grated parmesan cheese.</p><p>Method: Blitz the dressing ingredients together. Serve the salad – the leaves, croutons and dressing all together-- preferably as a light starter.</p><p>                                                                                      -Carla Phillips  </p></body></html>
