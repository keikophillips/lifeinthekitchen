<body><p>HAITIAN STYLE CHICKEN</p><p></p><p></p><p>This easy way of preparing chicken in a personal favourite. When I was little and my parents worked full time, a Haitian housekeeper made this for the family. My mother quickly learned the recipe and made it very often- sometimes using a whole cut up chicken and sometimes using just a few parts – the legs, thighs, breasts…So it is extremely flexible and can be scaled down or up. Served hot, it is very fine, but it is also delectable cold, so that I usually prepare extra. But even if it is simple to prepare it does require an overnight marinade.</p><p>Ingredients (for two): 2 chicken pieces, or half a chicken; 1 lime; 1 clove of garlic, crushed; a half chilli, deseeded, deveined and very finely chopped; ½ teaspoon of dried oregano; salt and pepper; 1 teaspoon of tomato puree; a tablespoon of frozen peas; chopped parsley; a little cooking oil.</p><p>Method: Make the marinade by juicing the lime and mixing it with the garlic, chilli, dried oregano and some salt and pepper. Rub this well into the chicken pieces, and place them in a bowl to marinade overnight, turning them at least once. </p><p>Next day (or evening), remove the chicken pieces from the marinade, reserving it. Dry the chicken with a paper towel. Heat up a little cooking oil and fry the chicken pieces in the hot fat until they have coloured slightly. Then place them in an oven-proof casserole. Add the tomato puree and marinade to the hot oil, mix briefly, then pour this over the chicken. Cover and roast for 20-30 minutes, until the chicken is done. Then add the peas. Remove the casserole from the oven in order to allow the chicken to ‘rest’. Finally add the parsley.</p><p>This dish is particularly good served with rice cooked in almost any style,</p></body></html>
