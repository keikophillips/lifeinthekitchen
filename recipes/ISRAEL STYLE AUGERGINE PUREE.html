<body><p>ISRAELI STYLE AUBERGINE PUREE</p><p></p><p>Rich,  unctuous, this is my favourite dip, to be served with toast, bread, veggies, or as a sauce.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 large aubergine; a dollop (heaping tablespoon) of mayonnaise; 2 teaspoons of lemon juice; 1 clove of garlic; a small pinch of ground cumin; salt, pepper, a little cayenne; a tablespoon of olive oil.</p><p>Method: Remove the stem of the aubergine and stab it a few times (to prevent a messy explosion). Bake it on a tray in a hot oven until it is soft and squishy to touch. You may have to turn it round once. This will take from40-50 minutes. Then, place it on a colander to drain it . You can weigh it down, though this is not strictly necessary. Now, into a bowl, scrape out as much of the inside flesh as you can. To this add the pinch of cumin, the garlic, lemon juice and mayonnaise.</p><p>Mix these together well either by blitzing with a stick blender or in a food processor. Season it, then trickle in the olive oil, mayonnaise-style. Leave it to chill for a few hours before serving.</p><p>In a fridge this will last for a couple of weeks. </p><p>                                                                             -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
