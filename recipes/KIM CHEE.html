It requires an overnight soak in a large bowl, but very little time or work otherwise. If you can, try to get hold of the wonderful Korean chilli powder. Oriental supermarkets stock it, and it has a superb aroma and taste, which will have you using it in all sorts of other recipes. Otherwise, 4 or 5 red chillies finely chopped will do.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: Approximately 2-2and ½ kg Chinese leaves- say 2 Chinese cabbages; ½ teacup salt (non-iodized); 4 spring onions; 3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger; 3 tablespoons finely chopped or grated garlic; 2 tablespoons Korean chilli powder (or 4-5 red chillies, finely chopped; ½ grated mouli (Japanese radish) 1 tablespoon sugar; 1 tablespoon soy sauce (light).</p><p></p><p>Method: Quarter and then slice the cabbages, not too finely. In a large bowl (stainless steel, enamel, glass, plastic) toss the leaves with the salt and then cover them with water. Weigh it down slightly and then leave overnight, at room temperature.</p><p>Next day, drain, but don’t rinse. Toss with the remaining ingredients and then pack it tightly into clean glass jars. Cover them.</p><p>Leave these jars at room temperature for 2-4 days. Open the jars once or twice each day, and poke around with a skewer or sharp knife to release gasses. It will mellow in flavour.</p><p>Then, store in a fridge or cool place. The Kim Chee will last for months, though it will strengthen in flavours.</p><p></p><p>                                                     - Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
