It'’ the Persian version of '‘tortilla'’- their variation of egg and potato cake. It can be served hot or cold, and though it is often cooked on top of the stove, I usually make it in a small roasting or tray-bake tin in the oven. When there are a lot of people and I’m serving it as a nibble I double the quantities, use a large roasting tin and cut it into bite sized squares.</p><p>It’s startling in appearance - bright, violent green! The texture us light, almost spongy. Served in large wedges with yogurt and a side salad, it’s a fine main dish. I usually serve it cut up small as part of a finger buffet.</p><p>Ingredients: 1 large potato, peeled, cut up into small segments, boiled in salty water, then mashed; 100g spinach; a small onion; 2-3 cloves of peeled garlic; a large handful each of parsley, coriander and dill, and, if in season, mint; ½ teaspoon of ground cardamom; a level teaspoon of salt, some pepper and cayenne; 6 eggs;  a smallish slice of feta cheese.</p><p>Method: First of all, line a small roasting or tray-bake tin with same silicon (bakewell) paper. Oil it very lightly. Next, in a food processor, combine the spinach, herbs, mashed potato, seasonings and spices with the eggs. Blitz it very thoroughly to a fine mush. Then pour it into the tin. Grate some feta on it, and bake it in a medium oven for about 20 minutes, or until it is set. As I said before, it is fine hot or cold.</p><p></p><p>                                                              -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
