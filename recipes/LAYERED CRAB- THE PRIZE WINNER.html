<body><p>LAYERED CRAB- THE PRIZE WINNER</p><p></p><p></p><p>How did I get started in catering? </p><p>Many years more than I care to count, I won a big national cookery contest with a variation of the dish I’m going to show you this month. It was a layered dish of local sea food over a base of barely steamed samphire, destemmed, destalked. I still make it when samphire is around (it will be, soon-) but I have a new variation which you might be interested in trying when samphire is not available. It  copnsists of substituting lightly cooked sprouting broccoli, that is, chopping the stems into small segments, immersing them into a fair amount of boiling salted water, then removing them and chilling them rapidly by sunning them under a cold tap or dunking them into some very cold water, before draining well. This refreshes the broccoli and preserves their lovely emerald colour.</p><p>Since crabs and our delicious little brown or pink shrimp are once more readily available at Frary’s stall, all is ready for a lovely cold entrée or luncheon dish. It looks appetising in a glass bowl or little glass cups or ramekins.</p><p>Ingredients (for 3-4): 1-2 cups of shrimps (the rfeady peeled ones are dearer, but if you peel them yourself, the shells make an excellent base for fish soup or stock); 2-3 handfuls of ready cooked sprouting broccoli; 3 medium to large crabs, the brown meat and the white meat separated into different bowls; 1 teaspoon light soy sauce; 1 teaspoon sherry; 2 teaspoons of brown breadcrumbs; 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise; 1 lemon, halved; 1 heaping teaspoon of mild (Korma) curry paste; paprika, cayenne.</p><p>Method: First of all, layer the bottom of your bowl (or cups0 with the broccoli. Then mix the brown meat of the crab with the soy sauce, breadcrumbs and sherry.  Spoon this over the greens, gently flattening it out. Next, mix the white meat with the juice of half of the lemon and distribute this over the brown meat. </p><p>Now, stir the curry paste and the juice of the remaining half lemon into the mayonnaise and carefully cover the white meat. Last of all, sprinkle the shrimps with some paprika and a little cayenne and scatter them over the mayonnaise layer. </p><p>Voila!  A new version of my prizewinner!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                 -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
