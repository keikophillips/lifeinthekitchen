For lunch we stopped in the middle of Orleans at a large, popular place which specialized in French fast food: burgers, croque monsieurs, etc. Prominently featured was ‘Le Welsh’.</p><p>Curious about it, I ordered this Gallic take on Welsh Rarebit, and found it delightful. My host, a former chef, knew the chef at the restaurant, who obliged him with describing just how it was made. Here we go!</p><p>Ingredients: 80-90g cheddar, red or white; 60ml beer (2 tablespoons)- light ale; 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce; a few drops of Tabasco; 1 egg;1 piece of toast; optional- a thin slice of ham.Use a well buttered heavy plate or baking dish.</p><p>Method: Grate the cheese as finely as you can. Then place this in a bowl and mix in the liquid ingredients very well. You will need either a lot of effort or possibly a stick blender to really make this into a proper mushy paste. </p><p>Place the toast into the bottom of your baking dish. If you are ujsing ham, place this on top. Cover with the sauce. Break the egg on top and season it well with salt and pepper. Now either bake it for 7 minutes or so in a very hot oven, or place it under a grill, cooking it until the egg is set. </p><p>Serve with either more toast, or as they did in Orleans, with chips. Voila!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
