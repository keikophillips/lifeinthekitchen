<body><p>LEMON DRIZZLE CAKE – ROS’ VERSION</p><p></p><p>A winner, no matter which recipe you use- this is my personal favourite of all the recipes I have tried. </p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 120g butter (softened); 140g caster sugar; 140g self raising flour; 2 eggs; 60ml milk (5 tblsp); zest of 1 lemon. Topping: 85g icing sugar; juice of 1 lemon.</p><p>7inch cake tin greased and lined; 1 meat skewer.</p><p></p><p>Method: Beat the butter till light and fluffy. Add the sugar and lemon zest and beat well. Then add the eggs, one by one, and finally the flour (with a pinch of salt)and the milk.  Spoon the mixture into your lined tin, and bake, in a medium oven for 40-50 minutes, until done. If it starts to brown too much on top, place a flat tin on top of it.</p><p>Make the syrup of lemon juice and icing sugar before the cake comes out of the oven. Prod the baked cake all over with the meat skewer, then pour over the syrup. Leave it to cool in the tin.</p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
