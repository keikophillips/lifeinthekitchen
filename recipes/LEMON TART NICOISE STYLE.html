<body><p>LEMON TART, NICOISE STYLE</p><p></p><p>When this was made, by a variety of wonderful cooks, for the Twinning Committee’s biannual feast, up at the high school, it was greeted with delight, by many of the diners. Indeed, I was stopped several times on the street, to ask for the recipe, which is why it’s featured this month. Unlike most lemon puddings, except for the crust, it contains no cream or butter, thus sitting lightly on the tummy after a slap-up dinner.</p><p>The recipe comes from Peter Graham’s translation of Jacques Medecin’s ‘Cuisine Nicoise’, ‘The Cooking of Nice’. Medecin was mayor and noted for being fairly shady, but his recipes are wonderful.</p><p>I’ve altered the recipe slightly from the original. First of all, I prefer my own pastry to the one in the book. And also, I’ve doubled the quantity of sugar specified, from 20 grams to 40 grams. Not a lot in any case, and the tartness of the taste is in no way compromised.</p><p>Ingredients: For the pastry: 150g plain flour; 100g butter; pinch of salt; a little cold water. For the filling: 2 small or 1and ½ large lemons; 40g sugar; 4 eggs; 1 tsp cornflour.</p><p>Method: Crumble the butter into the flour and salt. Add enough water to make a dough. Shape this into a disc and wrap it in film. Chill for an hour. Roll it out on a floured surface and place in an 8 or 9 inch pie or tart tin. Prick it all over with a fork, line this with foil and place inside the foil either baking beans (I use the same dried broad beans I’ve had for 20 years) or ceramic ‘beans’. Bake in a hottish oven for 10 minutes. Then remove the foil(and beans), and bake for another 5-7 minutes, until the bottom of the tart looks as though it is dry. This is called ‘Blind Baked’ pastry.</p><p>For the filling: Separate the yolks and whites of eggs, placing the yolks in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Beat the yolks with half the sugar. Then grate in the rind of one of the lemons. Next, squeeze in the juice. Finally add the cornflour. Cook, stirring, over a very, very low heat until the mixture has just started to thicken and coat the spoon. Remove from the heat. Now, whisk the egg whites until they are stiff and then fold in the remaining 20 grams of sugar. Whisk a little bit longer, then combine the yolk and white mixtures by first stirring in a little bit of the yolk mixture into the whites, then folding in the rest swiftly afterwards. Place this in the crust and bake it for 15-20 minutes in a hottish (400’) oven. It should be golden brown, and fluffy. Don’t worry when it sinks a little after it has cooled; it is still light and ethereal and a delight to serve – with cream or without.</p><p>                                                                                -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
