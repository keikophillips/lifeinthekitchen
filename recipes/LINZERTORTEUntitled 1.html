Rich and somewhat tricky because of the dough’s high butter and ground almond content, the ingredients are simple but a bit of patience is required in the rolling out.</p><p></p><p>Contents: For the pastry: 150g ground almonds; 150g plain flour; 150g butter; 110g caster sugar; 1 tsp salt; zest of 1 lemon; juice of ½ lemon; 2 egg yolks.  For the filling 200-300g raspberries and a small jar of raspberry jam or fresh stoned apricots (depends on size) and a small jar of apricot jam.</p><p>An 8inch or 20cm two-part tart pan.</p><p></p><p>Method: Mix the almonds, flour, salt, lemon zest and sugar together. Cut the butter into small segments and crumble it into the dry ingredients. Mix the egg yolks with the lemon juice and add a tablespoon of cold water to it .Add this and mix it into the flour- butter mixture, adding a very little water, if necessary. With floury hands form it into a ball, wrap it in either clingfilm or put it in a plastic bag and chill it well.</p><p>When you are ready to bake it, place a flat tray or pan into a medium oven to heat up. Roll out 2/3 or so of the dough onto a lightly floured sheet of cling film. It should be thin enough and large enough to form the base of the tart. Refrigerate the remaining dough. Reverse the dough rolled on the clingfilm into the tart tin, Cut off any bits flapping over the sides. If there are any gaps, just dab in a little more dough. Line this crust with a piece of aluminium foil and cover this with baking beans. Place this on the already hot tray in the oven and bake it for 10 minutes. Then, remove the foil and beans and return the crust to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes. </p><p>Meanwhile line another tray or baking sheet with clingfilm. Roll out the remaining dough onto it, shaping it into a rectangle. Refrigerate this until you are ready to assemble to tart.</p><p>To assemble the tart, spoon enough raspberry jam on the bottom of the tart shell to cover it well. Then tip in your raspberries (the more, the merrier, I think!).  In the winter you can use frozen raspberries. Cover this fruit with a generous coating of the raspberry  jam. </p><p>Remove the tray of rolled out pastry dough and cut out strips of the pastry. Form this into a lattice-  the chilled dough strips are easier to manipulate than the pastry at room temperature.</p><p>Bake the tart for 15-20 minutes, until the strips of pastry are starting to colour.</p><p>For apricots, follow much the same procedure, with the bottom coated with jam, then the fresh fruit, arranged, and then the jam spooned over,</p><p>Leftover dough, then rolled out and re-used as jam cookies. Roll it out a little more thickly than if it were intended for a tart. Stamp it into rounds with a cookie cutter, depress the center of each circle and dab it with a bit of jam. Bake fir 10-12 minutes, until light golden brown then cool on a wire rack.</p><p></p><p>                                                                    -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
