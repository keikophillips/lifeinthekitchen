<body><p>LITTLE SAVOURY BISCUITS</p><p></p><p> I used to call these the ‘Little Savouries for the Ladies Who Lunch.’ They would be terrific at a drinks party- easy and quick to make and they don’t splat and stain the carpet!</p><p>Ingredients: 100g plain four; 100g unsalted butter; 30g drained tinned anchovy fillets; 70g stoned Greek olives; 50g grated Gruyere cheese; 50g grated parmesan cheese; ½ tsp ground black pepper; a little beaten egg or egg white (to glaze the biscuits before baking).</p><p>Method: First chop the anchovies and olives together – this shouldn’t take long. Then cut the butter into the flour,  or rub it in, pastry style. Add the cheese and black pepper. Then mix in the anchovy-olive  mix and form it all into a ball. Roll it on a floured surface, then cut it into little rounds. Transfer these to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Chill them for at least 20 minutes, until you’re ready to bake them. The brush them with the beaten egg (or egg white)- and bake them in a medium hot oven (190’ or gas 5’) for 15-18 minutes, until they are golden. Cool on a wire rack before storing in an air tight tin.</p><p></p><p>                                                                       -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
