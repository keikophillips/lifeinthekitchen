<body><p>LITTLE SAVOURY PASTIES</p><p></p><p>Having a drink, without something to eat, strikes me as unpleasant. And sometimes, it’s necessary to produce something bite-sized which will either serve as an hors d’oeuvre or a light meal.</p><p>These little pastries are something I’ve made for years. They are cook-friendly, can be made  ahead of time, then rewarmed for ten minutes in a low oven. They can also be pre-prepared , left in the fridge then baked for twenty minutes in a very hot oven.</p><p>Originally, I rolled out puff pastry  thinly then stamped circles which I  filled and fashioned into half moons. Nowadays, I roll out the pastry thinly into a good-sized square and cut it into 3 inch (7cm) squares, then turn  into filled triangles. Much less work! </p><p>Ingredients: 1 packet of puff pastry. If you can get the sort that is made with butter, it’s nicer, otherwise the ordinary one will do.;3 large or 4 small eggs; 2 tablespoons of cream; a tablespoon of butter; salt and pepper; 2 or 3 slices of smoked salmon.</p><p>Method: Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk lightly. With a tablespoon, extract a tablespoon of the beaten egg and place in a small bowl  with the same amount of milk or water. This will be enough for sealing and glazing the pastries.</p><p>Heat the butter in a saucepan or small frying pan. Add the eggs and cream, stirring gently till it is a thick creamy curd. Immediately pace this in a cold bowl to prevent further cooking and add chopped snippets of the smoked salmon. Stir to blend.</p><p>On a lightly floured surface roll out the puff pastry as thin as you dare. Cut into squares. Brush the edges of these squares lightly with  egg wash. Place teaspoons of the filling in one corner of each square, then fold over to form triangles. Press with a fork to seal. Place the triangles on a Bakewell- paper lined pastry sheet. Brush the tops with the egg wash.</p><p>Now, chill them until 20 minutes before you are ready to bake them in a very hot oven, prior to serving. They should be a warm golden brown. They can rest in a gently warm oven, or, as said before, gently reheated .</p></body></html>
