Most are wonderful simply cooked ‘as is’, steamed or boiled in a little water, salted or not as you prefer.</p><p>Now, if you have some extra cooked vegetables: peas, new potatoes, turnips, carrots, broad or green beans,  and later in the season, corn on the cob, let me recommend an authentic ‘Macedoine’ or ‘Russian Salad’.</p><p>Not that gloopy stuff out of tins which used to be a feature of public catering when I first hit England in the very early 1960s. No! What I’m suggesting is that you cut up your cooked potatoes, turnips, carrots into smallish pieces, to be mixed with your peas and chopped beans. If your broad beans are humungus</p><p>Peel them by crushing the skin lightly between your forefinger and thumb. Mix them all gently together and then dress them with mayonnaise (shop bought is fine) to which you add a good teaspoonful of Dijon mustard and a significant splash of lemon juice.</p><p>Unless you’ve got some yellow beetroot available, don’t add the red stuff; the taste dominates and it leaches red into the rest of the salad. And don’t include cooked legumes such as kidney, chickpea, lentils or butter beans. Their granular texture totally obliterates the delicacy of the new spring veggies.</p><p>However, a small quantity of cooked mushrooms won’t harm the mixture. Do add chopped parsley and a little finely minced tarragon if you have any.</p><p>Dollop this salad onto some nice young lettuce leaves and either serve as is, for a lovely starter, or with a hard boiled egg or two as a more than satisfactory lunch.</p><p>Later in the season, you can hollow out a halved tomato, then scoop out its middle and seeds. Salt the interior slightly and leave it to drain for ten minutes. Then pile the Macedoine into the tomato halves and serve with dressed crab, a little leftover cooked fish or some other shellfish. This is quite an elegant cold meal.</p><p>                                                                                        -Carla Phillips0</p></body></html>
