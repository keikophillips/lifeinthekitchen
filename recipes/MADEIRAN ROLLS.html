This is because, though they are pretty well self sufficient in wheat – there isn’t quite enough, and they have had to supplement their baking doughs with a more plentiful carbohydrate. This dough, slightly sweetened, naturally, by the higher quantities of natural sugars, makes for particularly tasty rolls, which are served everywhere on the island. Heated, split in the middle and buttered with garlic and parsley butter, they appear frequently  with poultry or fish.</p><p>I have searched out recipes- and have finally settled on a combination of various ones- compiled from a badly translated cookbook, the net, and the words of  the proprietor of an open air stall near Funchal Town Market. Easy to make, filled with all sorts of nutritional goodies from the sweet potato content, they have become quite a hit in my household. They freeze beautifully, so I make a large batch which  lasts well.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 large or 2 medium sweet potatoes; approximately 600g strong flour; 2 packets of yeast; a pinch of sugar; 12 grams of salt (2 teaspoons); 200ml warm water; 1 tablespoon of salad oil.</p><p></p><p>Method:  Bake the sweet potato(es) in a hottish oven for 50 minutes to an hour, until quite soft to the touch. Then, when cooled off enough to handle, peel  and mash the flesh. Weigh it up in a large-ish bowl, then add enough flour to total 900grams in weight. </p><p>Now, remove 3 large tablespoons of the flour, and combine it with the warm water, a pinch of sugar and the yeast. Mix well and leave, covered, for 30 minutes in a warmish place.</p><p>Now, add the salt to the remaining flour-potato mixture, and combine it with the slightly bubbly ‘sponge’, together with the tablespoon of oil. Combine it all – you may need to add some extra water (the proportions and quality of flour and sweet potato determines this), Knead it well for 5 to 8 minutes. Then place the dough in the large bowl , cover it and allow it to rise for 2 hours.</p><p>When you remove the risen dough from the bowl,it will deflate. With your hands, stretch and roll the dough into a long ‘sausage’ and cut this into 2 ½ -3 cm chunks. Place them on trays lined with baking paper. You should have between 28 and 20 rolls. Leave theswe to rise in a warmish place, then bake in a hot oven for 15-20 minutes until lightly brown on top.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
