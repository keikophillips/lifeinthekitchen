<body><p>MAINCROP POTATOES</p><p></p><p>Maincrop potatoes are one of the first great treats of late summer, early autumn. They may lack the waxy firmness and sweet taste of late spring wonderspuds, but they more than compensate with their delightfully crumbly, collapsing structure and earthy undertones of taste.</p><p>Of course they are splendid when baked. Straight out of the oven, bashed slightly (in order set their collapse in motion), split and served with butter, salt and black pepper. Or, if you like it, served with only a little butter, then some Greek-style yogurt, minced chives or spring onions, then salt and pepper. Bliss.</p><p>Or, you can hollow out the baked potato, scooping the ‘meat’ out of the delicate shell. Mash this potato well, season with salt and pepper, then grate a little onion into it. Next, mix in  some grated cheddar, a little butter and a small dollop of mustard. </p><p>How much, I can hear you asking? As much as you fancy. Taste and try it. Then, pile it back into the skin-shell and grate a tiny amount more cheese on top of it. Return it to the oven—either a hot oven for about 15 minutes, or a low oven for about 25 minutes.</p><p> The other maincrop potato treat I thought I’d mention in this piece is a method of using leftover mashed potatoes. This is popular with family and friends and is an ideal easy supper or snack. Again, I’m not going to be precise about weights and measures as, in the case of leftovers, this is always variable.</p><p>If you have more than a teacupful of mash, place it in a bowl. Grate a little fresh onion into the spuds. Or, if you have some, substitute some finely chopped spring onions. Stir this into the potatoes. Break an egg into this mixture and stir well. Then stir in enough plain flour to make this mixture malleable, firm, easy to handle. Season this mixture to taste. </p><p>Finely slice some hard cheese: gruyere, Jaarlsberg, Mrs Temple’s mountain cheese, cheddar, White Stilton- whatever you like and have on hand. You want a few little slivers, roughly the size and shape of £2 coins (maybe a bit bigger).</p><p>Make little potato cakes by surrounding each little cheese sliver with mash. Roll each potato cake in breadcrumbs (dry commercial ones will do). Fry these little cakes in hot oil until golden brown. If you haven’t had these before, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. Variations I’ve tried include covering the little sliver of cheese with chopper anchovy or black olive puree. These are fine, but the added sophistication is not strictly necessary.</p></body></html>
