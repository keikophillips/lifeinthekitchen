They don’t take any great feats of skill, but the making of them and setting of them has to be spread out over a bit of time.  I will give the ingredients with each bit, but if you’re doing a general shop for the whole thing, this has to be taken into consideration.The original recipe specified a 23’ x 33’  (9 x 13 inch) tin, so try to use one which has the approximate  amount of room.</p><p></p><p>The ‘digestive biscuit’ bottom</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 230 g butter; 50g dark brown sugar; 50g granulated sugar; 50g runny honey; 210g whole wheat flour; 130g white flour; 1 tsp salt; ½ tsp ground cinnamon</p><p></p><p>Method: Cream the butter with the sugars and honey. Add the dry ingredients. Then form the dough into a flattish round, wrap it in cling film and chill it for an hour. Line the baking tin with silicon (bakewell) paper. Roll out the dough between two sheets of cling film (this makes it easier to handle). Place the bough in the pan, and prick it all over with the tine of a fork. Bake it in a medium oven for 18-20 mi9nutes, until it has lightly browned. Then allow it to cool completely.</p><p></p><p>The filling</p><p></p><p>Ingredients 3 level tblsp. of gelatine powder; a teacup of cold water; 300g sugar; 50g honey; 2 egg whites; a good pinch of salt; 1 tblsp. vanilla (you can substitute rum).</p><p></p><p>Method: Place the egg whites and salt in a very large bowl. Then put the sugar and honey and ½ teacup of water in  saucepan, and begin to heat it until the mixture reaches 240) (soft ball stage). Whip the egg whites until it forms soft peaks. When the sugar-honey mixture has reached the right temperature, pour it onto the egg whites, whisking it all the while. Continue to whisk for a minute, and the add the gelatine water mixture and the vanilla. Continue to whisk it for 6-7 minutes in the large bowl. The mixture should thicken and quadruple in size. Now place this on top of the digestive biscuit base, smoothing over the top. Allow it to set (at least 4 hours, but overnight is best).</p><p></p><p>The top</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 250g dark (good) chocolate; 150ml double cream</p><p></p><p>Method: Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place in a bowl. Bring the cream to the boil, then pour it over the chocolate pieces. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and shiny. Pour it onto the set marshmallow, and smooth it with a spatula.</p><p>Allow the glaze to set for about a half hour before marking and cutting it into little squares.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
