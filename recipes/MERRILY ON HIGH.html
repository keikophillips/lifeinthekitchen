<body><p>MERRILY ON HIGH!</p><p></p><p>Live theatre! Reduced audiences, masked, slightly chilly, distanced from neighbours – and yet the natural animal warmth of being in the same space with proper actors performing – acting, revives spirits. What a treat!</p><p>‘Merrily on High’ fEAST Theatre’s latest offering, brought good live theatre back to Wells Maltings Friday and Saturday There were.three original one acts, two by Rob John and one by Robin McLoughlin. First on: ‘O Come Let us  Adore Him’ by Rob John, with artistic director and producer of ‘fEAST’ playing Su, a desperately lonely lady fantasizing about the principal man in her life, the postman. Creating successions of romantic scenarios around a remote acquaintance, her loneliness echoes a great deal of our own lockdown experiences. </p><p>Next, Robin McLoughlin’s ‘Comfort and Joy’ played with great verve, by Owen Evans giving us a taste of seasonal scariness as he gives us us a grimly sinister Santa with a true taste for serious crime.</p><p>Finally, Rob John’s ‘The Triumph of the Skies’,. This is a real triumph, with a wonderful young actor, Sam Thompson playing Adeb, waiting for his best friend, a childhood school buddy. They meet annually and serenade their small Norfolk village with Christmas carols. This play encompasses so much- from growing up in modern rural Norfol, to modern technology, the educational and class system, all in sparkling dialect; it is feisty, homorous, tender and a truly successful performance.</p><p>Viva live theatre!</p><p>                                                                                       Carla Phillips   </p></body></html>
