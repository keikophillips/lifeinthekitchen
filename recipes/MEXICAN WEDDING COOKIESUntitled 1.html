<body><p>MEXICAN WEDDING COOKIES</p><p></p><p>I don’t know why they’re called ‘Mexican Wedding Cookies’ either! Haven’t been to any Mexican weddings, couldn’t imagine serving cookies there, nor having a clue that the Mexicans cooked with walnuts...this recipe came from an American anthology from the 1960s, a collection of small community cookbooks. It’s simple, not sickly, stores well – what could be better?</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 100g of shelled walnuts; 200g butter; 270g flour; 1 tsp vanilla; 60g icing sugar; pinch of salt</p><p></p><p>Method: You can either grind the walnuts separately, or, if you have a processor, first grind the walnuts and then cream them with the butter, flour, sugar, pinch of salt and vanilla. Chill the dough for about 10 minutes, then form it into small balls and place on a baking sheet, lines with baking paper. Depress the centre of these little balls of dough somewhat, then bake them in a moderate oven until they start to brown. |Cool them off on a rack before dusting them with a little icing sugar. They store well.</p><p>                                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p><p>                                                                                                          </p><p> </p></body></html>
