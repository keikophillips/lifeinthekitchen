<body><p>MINORCAN ROLL</p><p></p><p>We were queuing for bread in a little village in the middle of Minorca. Each customer in front of me also bought brown and white slices of some sort of rolled pastry, so when it was my turn, I automatically pointed at them and said ‘Dos!’. This is a well-appreciated version of what I call ‘Minorcan Roll.’ </p><p></p><p>Ingredients: For the Caramel Syrup: 200g granulated sugar; 250ml water. For the cake: 4 eggs, separated; 2 teaspoons of melted butter;1 tsp vanilla extract; 180g caster sugar; 120g self raising flour sifted with ½ teaspoon of salt. 450ml double cream. </p><p>1 Swiss Roll tin, lined with Bakewell paper. Hottish oven (400’)</p><p></p><p>Method:  First prepare the caramel syrup. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, melt the sugar with a splash of the water, without stirring, until it starts to bubble and brown. Then you can swirl it occasionally, so that any cliffs of sugar on the edge of the saucepan break up into the body of the molten mixture. When it is a good rusty brown, remove from the fire, and pour in the rest of the water, standing well back as it will hiss and spit threateningly. Now return it to the fire and stir until the mixture is dissolved. This won’t take very long. Remove from the heat and leave this to cool. (This can be done well in advance.)</p><p>Now, make the cake. Break the eggs into 2 separate bowls – a large one for the whites, and a fairly small one for the yolks.  Melt the butter, and set aside. </p><p>Whip the egg whites until stiff. Then gradually add the caster sugar, meringue fashion. Don’t bother to wash out the egg beaters, and use them to beat the egg yolks until light. Add the butter and the vanilla.</p><p>Fold these into the egg white-sugar mixture rapidly. </p><p>Now sift the flour-salt mixture onto the mix, and fold them in. Spoon this mixture into the baking tin, and bake for 10-12 minutes, until  dark golden brown on top. Remove this from the oven, and roll it up in its paper, allowing it to cool.</p><p></p><p>While the cake is baking, whip the cream until stiff and leave in the fridge.</p><p>When the cake has cooled, unroll it carefully, and saturate it in the caramel syrup., pouring it on to both sides. Do this as rapidly as possible so that it doesn’t break up. Fill it with 2/3 of the cream and roll it up, then, with a spatula, cover the top and sides with the rest of the cream. Chill it well before slicing it on to plates.</p><p></p><p>Variation: For a very grown up version, I’ve occasionally added rum or brandy to the caramel syrup. But, this isn’t really necessary. </p><p></p><p>                                                                                                  Carla Phillips</p><p>                                                                                                   16 High Street</p><p>                                                                                                    Wells-next-the-Sea</p><p>                                                                                                     Norfolk NR23 1EP</p></body></html>
