<body><p>MOREISH</p><p></p><p>I take ‘moreish’  to mean the sorts of snacks and nibbles which, when placed in an accessible spot, disappear incredibly swiftly. Some of these titbits are too fancy or ‘cheffy’ for my olwn personal tastes. Here are two which hit my spot.</p><p></p><p>AUBERGINE PUREE</p><p></p><p>This is a version of an Israeli variation of this ubiquitous dip, good with thinly sliced toast, sourdough bread, or even some raw vegetables.</p><p>Ingredients: (serves 4-6)- 1 aubergine, approx 270-280g; 1 small clove of garlic; 2 tsp lemon juice; a small pinch of cumin; a pinch of cayenne; a pinch of salt; 1 good sized tablespoon of mayonnaise; 1 tblsp olive oil.</p><p></p><p>Method: Pierce the aubergine with a sharp knife in several places and roast it in a hot oven for 40 minutes, until it’s thoroughly floppy. Leave it to cool in a colander; it will ooze. Then, scrape the flesh away from the skin (which you discard). Place the flesh into a smallish mixing bowl, then add the cumin, salt, cayenne, garlic and lemon juice. Beat these well (a plunger mixer will do well). Then add the mayonnaise, and finally dribble in the olive oil.  This puree will last for 10 days to a fortnight. </p><p></p><p>LITTLE ONION SANDWICHES</p><p></p><p>Before you react with total misbelief, consider that these sandwiches were once the welcome staple treats of American ladies lunches, back in the 1950’s. And very welcome they were. If you follow all the steps carefully, and they are easy ones, you will see why.</p><p>Ingredients: 1 loaf of sliced white bread. Get the best you can; 1 large bunch of parsley, finely chopped; 1 very large Spanish (sweet) onion, thinly sliced into very fine rounds; Mayonnaise (Hellmans. Etc are fine); salt and pepper</p><p></p><p>Method: The night before you need these, immerse your finely sliced onions in cold water, and leave them to soak for several hours, draining, then changing the water at least once before the next morning. Then, soak the onions for an hour or two but this time in salted water. Now, drain well. </p><p>Now, spread the sliced bread thinly with mayonnaise. Scatter the onion slices on half of these slices and make them into sandwiches. Trim the crusts from the bread. Place the chopped parsley onto a tray or shallow dish. Then cut the sandwiches into dainty-ish triangles. With a spatula spread a thin coating of the mayo onto the sides of these triangles and dip or roll these in the chopped parsley. After this, place them onto a serving dish or tray. They can be covered with cling film and set aside for several hours.  </p><p>Once they have been tried, you’ll be astonished at how rapidly these little things will disappear.</p><p></p><p>Carla Phillips</p><p>16 High Street</p><p>Wells-next-the-Sea</p><p>Norfolk NR23 1EP</p><p>Telephone 01328-710852</p></body></html>
