<body><p>MOROCCAN VEGETABLE SOUP – MY VERSION</p><p></p><p>At first I made this soup using the fine recipe from ‘The Soup Bible’ (the best collection of soup recipes I’ve ever found). Through the years I’ve altered and added to the original, and this version is truly formidable. When I cannot obtain pumpkin or winter squash, I substitute butternut squash. I incorporated the original garnish for the soup into the body of the recipe as well as adding some spice.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 tblsp olive oil; 1 tblsp butter; 250g onions, chopped; 250g carrots, chopped; 250g parsnips, chopped; 250g pumpkin or squash, chopped;  1 clove of garlic; chopped; 1 tsp ground cumin; 1 tsp ground coriander; 1 tsp ground turmeric; 1 litre of vegetable stock; salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne; a handful of fresh coriander; a handful of parsley; juice of a lemon; a pinch of paprika.</p><p></p><p>Method: In a large, hot saucepan, melt the butter and oil together, then tip in the onions. Mix them well, lower the heat and leave them to cook, covered  for about 5 minutes. Next, add the carrots and parsnips, stirring them well. Cover the pan and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Now add the squash and garlic, cooking them for another 5 minutes. Add in the spices, stir for a minutes, then finally add the vegetable stock. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are soft. Now, remove from the heat  and add in the herbs, seasoning and lemon juice.  Zap the mixture with a stick blender pr puree it in a blender or processor. Correct the seasoning and add the paprika. If it seems too thick, add a little water.</p><p>The texture, colour and robust flavour of this soup should cheer you up during these dark December days.</p><p>                                                                   </p></body></html>
