<body><p>MOUCLADE</p><p></p><p>I discovered this dish during my restaurant days. A customer who’d enjoyed this on a trip to Southwest France told me about it. Mussels in a rich creamy yellow sauce and ‘ Please could we do this on Saturday night?’</p><p>Out came the recipe books and various versions were tried and rejected. The dish originated from one of the French Atlantic ports and used curry in the French manner, that is very mildly. It originally called for white wine but we found that the local dry cider worked perfectly, and can be used relatively lavishly. As our very fine local mussels are now available, and once you’ve had your first or second ‘hits’ of Moules Mariniere, here’s a very fine way of preparing them. Most of the work can be done in advance, so it is a useful dish for entertaining.</p><p>Ingredients: (for 2) a litre or 2 pints of mussels; 2-3 celery stalks; 3-4 shallots; ½ litre dry cider; 3 egg yolks; 1and1/2 level teaspoons of mild curry powder; 150mlo (small container) double cream; a walnut sized knob of butter</p><p>Method: Scrub and de-beard the mussels. Place them in a saucepan with half the cider, the chopped shallots and celery . Cover, bring to the boil and when the mussels have opened (3-4 minutes), remove them and shell them, saving all the liquid. Return the liquid to the heat, boiling it fiercely to reduce by a half.</p><p>In a separate heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the curry powder, egg yolks and the cream mixing it well. Then strain in the hot mussel and cider liquid, stirring it constantly over a fairly low heat until it just starts to coat a spoon. Then remove from the heat and stir in the butter.</p><p>When you’re ready to serve it, heat the remaining cider. When it just comes to the boil, add the mussels to the hot liquid to reheat them. This should not take more than a minute or two. Place them in a warmed shallow baking dish or plate, spoon the sauce over them, then place the dish under a grill or in a very hot oven, very briefly, to reheat until the edges just start to bubble. To accompany this, as a main dish, serve plain rice, and lots of brightly coloured , simply prepared vegetables: broccoli, carrots, beans,etc.</p><p></p><p>                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
