The sauce is also a fine accompaniment to plainly cooked fish, meat, or even hard boiled eggs.  The sauce, ‘Salsa Verde’ (Italian) or ‘Sauce Verte’ (French) is easily made ahead of time. When served with mussels, you open them ahead of time in a glass of cider, to which you’ve added a little chopped onion and celery. When you’ve opened the mussesls, remove them from the liquid, discarding their shells. Strain the liquid into a wide saucepan. </p><p>Before serving, when all the other elements of your meal are ready, heat this liquid and immerse the mussels in it for a couple of minutes. Then drain and strain the mussels with the following sauce.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 shallot; 2 cloves of garlic; 4 anchovies; a large handful of parsley; a large handful of basil; 2 teaspoons of capers; 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar; pepper; a little cayenne; 100 ml of olive oil.</p><p>Method: Chop finely, or process together the shallot, garlic, anchovies, parsley; basil, capers and wine vinegar. Then gradually, trickle in the olive oil. Season to taste.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                   -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
