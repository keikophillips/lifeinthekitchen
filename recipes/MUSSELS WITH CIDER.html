During the winter months when the stall is not open they will be obtainable by phoning either of the brothers, Allan or Martin (telephone 711042  or 711075.</p><p></p><p>To sell these mussels, the family has gone through a long process of inspection and certification. It has taken years. However, it means that the mussels are pure and clean. Shellfish gathered in the wrong places or poorly handled can be very risky.</p><p></p><p>So, hereâ€™s one way to make your seasonal mussel feast. Find a large saucepan and slice a small to medium onion into it. Then add (and this is very important) two or three cut up blades of celery. Then a few peppercorns, a bay leaf or two, and a glassful of dry cider (Whin Hill!). Bring this rapidly to the boil and throw in your cleaned and debearded mussels> Bring it back to the boil, stirring once or twice and cook for about ten minutes. The shellfish should all be completely open and cooked.</p><p></p><p>Serve them as they come. If you wish to refine the recipe a little further, you can temporarily remove the mussels, and boil the liquid for about five minutes until somewhat reduced. Then you can stir in some cream and chopped parsley. Re-immerse the mussels in this very briefly then pour it into serving bowls, with the liquid over them. Serve with plenty of bread, or do as the Belgians and Northern French do, and serve them with chips!</p><p></p><p>                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
