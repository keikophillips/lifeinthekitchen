<body><p>MY FAVOURITE THINGS – FIFTY YEARS OF CHANGING MENUS</p><p></p><p>In March 1965, My husband Bernard and I came to Norfolk, to the coastal village of Burnham Overy Staithe. Bernard’s family ran a large hotel overlooking the creek and salt marshes. His dad, George, was in poor health, the family needed help. Bernard had been born and brought up there.</p><p></p><p>The Moorings Hotel, a large building fronting the creek, was made up of the original Georgian dwelling and its adjoining outbuildings and barns. Facing the water, directly across from its small island, alongside a large swimming pool which was fed and emptied by a tidal sluice, surrounded, seawards, by dramatically empty sea marshes across the creek, it was a very beautifully situated building.</p><p></p><p>It had been converted into a hotel in the 1920s by Bernard’s grandparents. His grandfather had quarrelled with his brothers and had been bought out of his share of the family distillery in London. He and his wife and children had come up to Burnham Overy for a holiday, renting a houseboat on Scolt Head Island. While on a day trip to Burnham Market they had spotted the notices for an auction sale at the Hoste Arms of the Moorings buildings and outbuildings. It was then called Staithe House and Grandpa bought it sight unseen, complete with a sitting tenant.</p><p></p><p>The sitting tenant died  and his daughter moved away to become an Anglican nun. Grandpa decided to convert it into a hotel. He hired local builders, told them what he wanted, and the new hotel opened later in the ‘20’s. His requirements included a central heating system and wash-hand-basins in each room, and it was roughly modelled on a model of a mini ‘Country House’. No locks on bedroom doors and plenty of old-fashioned service, from polished shoes, which would be left outside the bedroom doors, early morning teas (in bed), to food for accompanying dogs. As well as the swimming pool and a tennis court, there were marshes to explore, and of course, the boat to Scolt Head. Indoors, there were several lounges, a billiards room (doubling as a well stocked library – and of course, meal after meal.</p><p></p><p>Meal after meal. From early morning tea to a big breakfast. Then elevenses (coffee, tea and biscuits). A hearty lunch. Tea in the afternoon then a full meal in the evening. If lunchtime was skipped. Sandwiches would be prepared, with cake, etc. How did they manage to eat it all?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The hotel opened at the beginning of March and closed at the beginning of November. During the winter time, there were a few occasions when the hotel re-opened, for the Sailing Club banquet and the like, but winter was given over to family holidays, followed, in the New Year, by extensive spring cleaning and the making of the hotel’s own marmalade. This marmalade was made by a long process in which the fruit was sliced and soaked for several days in water; every receptacle in the establishment would be filled with a mixture of fruit and water and be left to stand...I still make it that way.</p><p></p><p>Even though there was this winter gap of time when it was not open, The Moorings was successful from its beginnings. It was mostly full, Indeed, the Board of Trade, which collected statistics from all hotels, informed the family that this was one of the most successful establishments of its sort throughout the UK, in spite of its truncated year. The hotel didn’t serve alcohol, even though guests were welcome to bring it along. This probably had to do with the licensing laws of the time. In the early 1960’s when the laws changed, the hotel acquired a license to serve drinks. Profits climbed, Indeed, it was this increase in profit which inspired the ultimate hostile takeover of the hotel and its demise.</p><p></p><p>At first the hotel employed professional cooks. But, Bernard’s Grandpa loathed the food they produced and Bernard’s Grandma took over in the kitchen, producing the sort of simple and homely food which was warmly welcomed by the guests. Bernard’s father, George, helped her in the kitchen. He had been in the Merchant Navy but he was happy to come out of it, and he and his young wife Muriel moved to Norfolk. But when the war came along, the hotel shut. George went into the navy immediately.</p><p></p><p>The village was a ‘no go’ area and the large building was requisitioned to house troops. Furniture was packed away into a few rooms and it became the headquarters of various soldiers. Old Mr Phillips died in 1943 and Bernard’s Grandma moved to her eldest daughter’s hotel in Surrey. My mother-in-law Muriel was living in a half-converted barn directly adjoining the hotel, with her young family while her husband, George, was in the navy, participating in a very, very active war – on convoys, destroyers – in Italy and Africa, he finally ended up as a beach master during the D-Day landings, and was just getting kitted up to ship off to the Fqr East, when the war finally ended.</p><p></p><p>My mother-in-law, originally from London, was more or less marooned in Overy Staithe. Across </p><p></p><p></p><p>the road from the hotel was a large field of glebe land which had been rented by the hotel. It provided all the vegetables and most of the fruit for the hotel. She had to keep this garden as best as she could, and this included keeping a couple of pigs, plus chickens. Some of the meat had to go back to the government, but she was also expected to provide her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law with some of the meat and veggies as well, dispatching them by post (via the railway in Burnham). Throughout the war, George sent her letters talking about planting seasons, gardening hints, horticultural suggestions. Bernard remembered helping her rub salt into shoulders of pig in order to make ham...a painful task.</p><p></p><p>When the war ended, Old Mrs Phillips didn’t want to return, feeling that she was too old to carry on. The building had been completely wrecked by the occupying troops and there was no compensation. So, it was put on the market but failed to meet its £1000 reserve price.  George, my father-in-law, had returned from war a weary and frail man. He decided that he would really like to join the river police. But, he was not tall enough to qualify. Someone recommended that he lie in bed for two weeks, and with a bit of luck he would stretch just that extra inch that he needed to qualify. Needless to say, this did not work. So, wearily,  he decided to restore the hotel, room by room, which he did over a few years, chiefly aided by a local builder, Nelson Scoles.</p><p></p><p>It reopened with just a few rooms, in 1947 and gradually was restored. And, it soon attracted the same sorts of clientele as before the war, and the same accolades it had previously won. Although there was rationing and  many of the privations common to war and post war England, there was still that magnificent vegetable garden. There was local game. Because the coastal waters had largely been out of bounds, there were plenty of fish and shellfish. Local beaches were gradually cleared of their mines, becoming once more accessible to the public. Once more, the hotel could revive its tradition of good food.</p><p></p><p>The hotel, like many of its kind, was a mini ‘Country House’. Early morning tea in one’s bedroom was followed by a lavish breakfast. Local bacon and sausages, mushroom, as well as bloaters from Wells, accompanied porridge or dried cereals. Toast from bread baked at Hewitt’s Bakery in Wells. Coffee and tea. Orange juice or grapefruit, the latter served looking intact, but really carved out of the carcass..</p><p></p><p>Elevenses consisted of tea or coffee, served with a simple bought biscuit. But, soon enough, the</p><p></p><p></p><p>brass gong would sound and lunch would be served in the large dining room directly overlooking the creek. There would be soup, usually an  invention of my father-in-law, made up of leftovers from the previous day, picturesquely entitled - ‘Norfolk Soup’, Romany Soup’, ‘Game Broth’ .. whatever came to his mind while Muriel typed up the daily menu for the Roneograph printer. There were also cold first course. In season, Globe Artichokes, with vinaigrette, Asparagus on Toast, with melted butter, both grown in the garden – or quite exotic, then, Spaghetti with Tomato and Bacon sauce. Sometimes Dressed Crab was on the menu. The crabs arrived boiled, but not dressed and everyone working in the hotel assembled in the kitchen around the enormous table in the middle in order to prepare them. My sister-in-law Mary remembers a few occasions when there were not enough people in hand and she did 30 crabs all on her own.</p><p></p><p>These were simply served, dressed and back in their shells, with mayonnaise and a quarter of lemon. There were also cooked meat dishes, and on Fridays a cooked fish dish like sliced halibut with cheese sauce. And, of course, there was always a cold option: yesterday’s roast served with salad. There were also cooked vegetables, served alongside the potatoes.  Puddings were often cooked ‘shapes’: semolina, tapioca, corn flour, served with stewed fruit or jam, or steamed suet sponges.</p><p></p><p>Tea was traditional but simple. Thinly sliced bread, cut into dainty sandwiches filled with cucumber, tomato or egg. Plain cakes, simple sponges or rock cakes and a few bought biscuits, and then there was a good break before the gong sounded around seven and supper was served. The food then was slightly fancier. Glorious fish: sometimes turbot, brill or sole, simply floured and then sauteed, served with a bit of flavoured butter (Maitre d’Hotel), followed by roasted partridges or pheasants, served with George’s inventive sauces, or chicken portions,  baked or roasted with, again, inventive sauces and accompaniments. </p><p></p><p>Like most cooks, George had his own likes and dislikes. He loved vegetables but cooked them longer than they do nowadays – but the quality and freshness of them still shone through. He did not like garlic, though he did grow a couple of rows of it for a couple of years after the war, when the family housed a strange French lady who insisted on eating it raw for her health.  His inventiveness really came out in his soups and sauces. And, his cooking skills were noticed in the early days of ‘The Good Food Guide’. It was in the second edition of that book that The Moorings appeared, continuing to feature until our family left.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Most of the main ingredients were fully traceable in origin. The meat came from Barkers, the Burnham Market butcher. Sundays, there were huge ribs of beef on the bone. George had been to a ‘carving school’ and was adept at handling the roasts, as was his eldest sister, Mary, who had sold her hotel in Surrey and joined him in the kitchen during the later years of the hotel. Mary was a good baker, and made meringues last thing at night, in a cooling electric oven which had been used during the main supper meal.</p><p></p><p>When the man smoking bloaters in Wells retired, Bernard went there for a couple of days in order to learn how they were done. He and his dad converted an outdoors loo up the garden, not far from the beehives, into a little smokehouse. Otherwise, fish came from Mr Farrow in Burnham: large turbot, cod and halibut. Large bowls filled with dabs or lemon soles.</p><p></p><p>Guinea fowl, partridges and pheasants came from Pettits of Reedham, who were also customers. Mrs Pettit made decorations from the feathers of their birds. Other fresh produce was delivered by wholesalers – milk coming from the local dairy in Burnham, who also delivered a rich and delicious cream cheese. Later on I mixed it with various fresh herbs, making a sort of Hungarian type of Liptauer cheese to be served along with the other cheeses, George would buy whole Stilton cheeses, often choosing one which had won prizes in various county shows (the Royal, the Royal Norfolk, and the East of England), He read about them in the EDP, then telephoned their makers. They were duly served in the large Victorian Stilton cheese dish, complete with its special knife, alongside other British cheeses.</p><p></p><p>Ice cream, made by a prize-winning Cambridge dairy, came by train and was picked up in Hunstanton. Wholesalers, including purveyors of fancy stuff like anchovies or special tinned fruits, came directly to the hotel as did the equivalent of a large cash-and-carry shop. There were no supermarkets then. Indeed when we suggested to Tim Aldiss, who owned a local department store, that a supermarket might be a very good idea, he replied that it would never go down well in England, particularly in Norfolk!</p><p></p><p>When we arrived in England, the hotel had only recently gained a liquor license. Bernard took over this. He read book after book about wine before starting a wine cellar using part of an outbuilding near the garages. He bought most of the wine from Peatling and Cawdron’s wine shop situated at the Globe in Wells. Some of those wines were stored for us in their vaulted cellar. Bernard and his dad also bid for some cases of special wines at specialist auctions. They constructed a small bar in one of the lounges which adjoined the dining room and I worked there before suppertime, trying my best to serve occasional cocktails (hastily looking them up in a booklet) as well as serving sherry and some aperatif style wines.</p><p></p><p>We found a house nearby and moved to Friars Lane, Burnham Norton in summer 1966. We moved there on the day that England won the World Cup. Bernard cycled to the hotel from Friars Lane where we lived and I stayed at home with our young children. Occasionally I made a few American-style puddings for the restaurant, but I was very busy indeed with our family, the house and the large (one acre) garden. It was then that my formation as a cook recommenced.</p><p></p><p>What was available in local shops was limited. No garlic. No peppers or aubergines. No chillies, yogurt, skimmed milk, soured cream. No un-dyed, smoked haddock or pickled herring. No fresh or frozen orange juice, The privations and frugality brought by war had diminished but the tastes of the general population had hardened. Even in a climate which is able to provide fresh vegetables virtually all during the year, the availability of some varieties had narrowed. And, there were few native English traditions of preserving vegetables. For instance, there is no local version of salting cabbage or turnips in order to make sauerkraut…</p><p></p><p>Here, I think I must familiarize you with a bit of my own background. I was born and raised in the USA. My parents were both immigrants from Russia, from families who regarded food as fuel. Their diets were both mostly plant based, designed to outlast temporary hardships. Porridge and hot cereals in the morning. Plenty of hearty vegetable soup, hot or cold, summer or winter. Bread designed to last a week to ten days, Pickled, cured, smoked and dried meat or fish. Dried mushrooms – all of these the mainstay of a Slavic diet.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, when we moved to Burnham, four times a week there were deliveries of old-fashioned bread. I could not abide the widely available tasteless fluffy commercial bread, found in many homes and shops. And I missed many mainstays of my New York style American diet, particularly various fermented milk products. Why couldn’t I find buttermilk, soured cream – or yogurt? During my first year living in Burnham Norton, I became ill with hepatitis. Because I could not digest fat, I wanted skimmed milk – not available then, except for a powdered dry skim milk which was imported from France. One early morning, on the farm programme, we listened to some farmers complaining that they could not sell enough milk. So we wrote and suggested that they try selling skimmed milk. Quick reply – there was no demand! When we asked about selling yogurt, the answer was the same.  We sent away for some yogurt culture and began making our own…</p><p></p><p>The ethos behind the cuisine at the hotel had been one of luxury. Standards were high but appreciated. The staff working at the hotel were provided with good meals, however, they always insisted on chips rather than potatoes prepared any other way. These were cooked for them but not for the regular hotel guests, each meal.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, as I made friends and got to know my new neighbours, I became more familiar with their daily diet. We all used a local travelling butcher, Kenny Edge, from South Creake, who called once a week. When I asked him what he sold most of, he pointed to the stack of trays in his little van containing ‘pig’s fry’, that is, a mixture of offal, liver, kidneys, which was often the sole fresh meat</p><p>meal each week. The local diet would be supplemented by tinned meat (Fray Bentos and Spam), some tinned fish and the occasional fish and chips. There were travelling vans for that too.  Local meals usually included fresh vegetables. For dessert, tinned fruits and some powdered ready-to-assemble puddings were popular. Pastries included sausage rolls and Norfolk Shortcake, the latter a pastry made with lard and flour, containing dots of more lard, sugar and dried fruit. Meals were accompanied with fruit squashes. Industrial sauces and jams were on hand as well as the ordinary squidgy fluffy bread.</p><p></p><p>My children by this time were at the local primary school along the road from where we lived. Even though the school dinners there were well conceived and prepared, many families prepared packed lunches for their children. These were often poor in nutrition, but preferred by the families. The school cook’s sensible way with vegetables {‘I just show the cabbage to the hot water’, she explained) were rejected. So, when my children held a birthday party, inviting their classmates, I would receive heartfelt pleas to provide sandwiches made with ‘shoppy’ bread and jam with plenty of fruit squash as an accompaniment.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, many local families had members who were ardent wildfowlers. Pigeon, rabbit, hare and of course, dubiously obtained pheasants and partridges formed part of many local family diets. Poaching, when I first moved to England, was more prevalent as the local trains which accessed \London would quickly ferry stuff down to the city. Nowadays, with pheasants being available so cheaply, this seems unimaginable. Then, there were weekly reports in the local  newspaper of poachers appearing before the local magistrates.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>There were also those who regularly gathered mussels, samphire and cockles. There had, over the years, been many public disagreements between authorities administering the marshes and coast over these gatherings. The uneasy balance between all these parties persists, though they all have a vested interest in preserving the coastal area.</p><p></p><p>The growing of vegetable crops became more industrialized, and ready-packed vegetables more common. There were many gangs of vegetable pickers, as well as seasonal fruit and soft fruit picker. On some farms there were travelling gangs for specialized crops, like asparagus. Some pickers were recruited locally, many of them housewives. Some of their gangmasters strutted around like cockerels…</p><p></p><p>The local diet included seasonings like mustard and horseradish. Mustard, grown locally, was dried by Colmans and sold in small tins in powdered form. It was dissolved, then left to stand for  short while before being used. Horseradish, common enough, a weed with a deep, pungent root, was grated before being combined with vinegar, sugar, salt and cream. There were a few horseradish ‘kings’ who would bring their whole families to the coast to dig for horseradish along the coastline during the winter months, Finely grated, combined with vinegar, sugar, salt and cream, it was often available and sold in small jars on stands along the roads between Lynn and Wisbech.</p><p></p><p>Parsley and mint were commonly used garden herbs. Saffron, which once was common in these parts, was largely unknown, and has only recently been revived through the offices of Dr Sally Francis, a Burnham Norton girl.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the mid 1970s that different dairy products became available in some local shops. There were even some exotic vegetables: aubergines, peppers, courgettes, chillies. More fruit: mangoes and lychees. It’s hard to imagine that salami or Brie cheese were so exotic that it took a drive to Norwich to obtain them. When  the first Leftley’s opened at the top of the High Street it seemed a boon and delight to be able to buy these things locally.</p><p></p><p>The shallow waters of our coast had been a great source of fishing for locals. Traditionally, dabs, a sort of flounder, were caught in the shallow creeks by walking around in the water with long rake-like forks with sharp prongs at the ends, which speared the fish as they swam in the shallows. \Well trimmed, then floured and fried, these were a popular local meal. Other fishing included laying out </p><p></p><p>nets along the beaches, which brought in sea trout, flounders, sea bass and grey mullet. There were also mackerel, dogfish, occasionally brill and sole. Most of these fish, and their fishermen, have largely disappeared  now, and local yields consist of crabs, lobsters, shrimps and whelks. </p><p></p><p>Oysters are raised along the coast, in Brancaster and Morston, and mussels continue to thrive, with Frary’s in Wells the most recent mussel fishery to begin around here. Cockles, which once upon a time were gathered in Stiffkey are still there but not gathered at all. Instead they are dredged from the Wash industrially, then boiled and shelled. Alas, they are often gritty prepared this way.  But the labour involved of walking a long way to the Stiffkey shoreline, then raking them up and carrying them home in a heavy sack to prepared them, makes this an unpopular job,  Along the shores of this coast, there are some razor clams and the large, rather ugly clams, which are called, in America, Quahogs, but these are not commercial.  Samphire has only gradually become a more commercial ‘crop’. For many years it was only picked by locals for family ‘feeds’. Nowadays a commercial picker will start in late June or early July, picking it along the Essex coast, gradually moving upwards through Suffolk and Norfolk as the season wear on, before finishing in late August along the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire marshes.</p><p></p><p>When I arrived, the meals at the hotel mirrored the food found at fancy country houses. Produce which is familiar today was absent. Local ordinary housewives, largely responsible for the diet in their own homes,, concentrated mainly on the familiar foods of their past. They were largely reluctant to try anything new, even though a lot of their food was adulterated. A widespread acceptance of many commercial farming practices did not benefit their diets, nor did some of the widespread overuse of chemicals, used both in feeding livestock and spraying on the land.</p><p></p><p>The hotel began to make good money in the 60s as a result of the licensing laws and the rise of tourism. However, when old Grandma Phillips died, this had not been the case. The nearly worthless shares in the hotel she had left to her sons. She left her three daughters a house each, so that my father-in-law had to buy the house he’d built and lived in, from his sister. The shares in the hotel, then without much value, were largely ignored by the family, until it began to prosper. Then, those in the family who had possessed the previously worthless shares began to take an interest. So, they received director’s fees.  A few of them were not content and decided that they had been cheated. They had a majority of shares, and as a result, were able to take over the hotel. George and Muriel, sick at heart left The Moorings. And, Bernard lost his job.</p><p></p><p></p><p>George was ill, dying and unable to move into the house he had bought next to the friary ruins on Friars Lane, near where we lived. Bernard had to find a new job, so decided to return to Cambridge and do a one year’s teacher training course. By this time, we had four very young children. Left alone with them from Monday morning to Thursday, I had to learn to garden as well as cook while looking after the house and kids. So, I was were grateful for the school dinners which the older children enjoyed. Sadly, years later, when Mrs Thatcher’s government came to power, these dinners were cut back. Cooking equipment was removed, ready-meals offered instead. The school cook, Mrs Franklin left, but continued to prepare her lovely meals for the old folk’s club and Meals on Wheels. ‘Turkey Twizzlers’ were served at school and packed lunches, often not nourishing, became normalized. Farm work diminished. This might have some good effects – when we first moved to our house, there was an adjoining field where I could watch single farm worker, hoeing sugar beet. Starting very early in the morning, he would not have finished by the end of the day. This must have been hard and dispiriting work. By the time we moved to Wells this job was mechanized.</p><p></p><p>With the mechanization of farming, there were more second homes available. The predominant employment was provided by tourism. Many of the farm cottages, no longer required for agricultural workers, were transformed into holiday accommodation. Television cooking programmes had begun to widen the horizons of many local cooks and cumbersome, slow Baby Belling cookers had been replaced with equipment which was far more adaptable. Microwaves and freezers proliferated. Accessible supermarkets appeared,</p><p></p><p>By the time my children were teenagers, Bernard and I had started a monthly magazine devoted to</p><p>the life and issues of this particular part of Norfolk. Set in newspaper format, we had articles and news about most aspects of this area, except for food. Unable to find a cookery columnist for ‘The Paper’, I temporarily took on writing this column, using the name ‘Cocotte, which in French means a sort of casserole saucepan as well as a flirt. For a couple of years, I wrote columns concentrating on local, easily available ingredients, which were easy to prepare. I drew these from memories of Moorings Hotel meals, my own Slavic heritage, popular American recipes using some of those ingredients,  and Bernard’s and my own memories of living and working in France for three years.</p><p></p><p>About this time, ‘The Sunday Times’ ran an annual cookery contest. Wondering if I could use some of our publication’s recipes for publicity, I submitted one, a cold crab dish made with local additions: samphire and brown shrimp. I got into the quarter finals and then ended up winning the prize itself. ‘The Sunday Times’ seemed slightly lukewarm about my winning. Previous victors lived in leafy Hampstead or high class parts of Cheshire. The paper described our kitchen as ‘family battered’ and mocked our habit lf occasionally eating ‘road kill’. But, with the prize money I was able to buy a car of my own, and publish a small book of my recipes, which sold out. We were given a new gas cooker, but as we couldn’t receive natural gas, it was a Calor gas stove. Our electricity bills were reduced by a third. I was also able to take on a few catering jobs, mostly freelance, then worked at Holkham’s Ancient House for Lord Leicester and Justin de Blank.</p><p></p><p>By then, momentous changes in education had begun. Bernard was was now head of English at a big high school in Kings Lynn. He felt swamped with the increasing paperwork and the burden of administration. He loved teaching but hated the rest of his job. He longed to return to catering. And so, we started to look for a place to have a restaurant. We had lived in France for three years and holidayed there with our children. We’d particularly loved little northern French seaside towns, with their modest, comfortable restaurants in every port.  We went to Wells very often,  whether for piano lessons, the library, the wine shop at Peatling and Cawdron, the children’s swing park or just to Leftley’s, which was the nearest delicatessen dealing in a wide choice of food. \We pictured a place near to the Quay, with the right ‘vibe’.</p><p></p><p>The cafe called ‘The Piscatorial  Emporium’ fitted the bill. It was a dinky building, obviously Georgian. But, it was not for sale. Open only six weeks a year, this was satisfactory for the then owner. But, when in the winter of 1985 it became available, we decided to try and acquire it. Needless to say, no one would lend us the money, Bank managers baulked at lending money for a property which was surrounded by 180 degrees of water. Even with Bernard’s hotel experience and my proven cookery skills, the situation seemed discouraging. Then, some local friends who we knew, who had a holiday house in North Creake, offered to provide funding. They bought the building and lent us enough money to refurbish it. With a very tight budget, a very good local builder and enough resourcefulness to equip and decorate the restaurant, using second hand catering and furnishing equipment,  making curtains and the table linen – all on a miniscule budget, we opened May 1986. We never looked back.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we couldn’t think of a name straight away. But when we asked Bernard’s mother, she wa to bes in charge of flowers – a key part, I’d always thought, of the old hotel’s charm, she said, conversationally, ‘Of course, you’ll call it ‘The Moorings’. Of course, indeed! Our culinary culture in the restaurant was a combination of our experiences, first of all the family traditions of using what was local and good. Next, the joint experiences of living and working in Paris, where I had</p><p></p><p>first learnt to cook, on often very primitive equipment. Student restaurants and domestic cooking, spurred on by Elizabeth David and Julia Child’s books as well as a French paperback primer. ‘Cuisine Pour Tous’ inspired us,. </p><p></p><p>My own Eastern European origins came in handy. The first time Bernard presented me with a kipper, I turned it into the Russian Salad I’d grown up with. My grandmother’s stuffed cabbage (which bombed when named as such, but became popular when renamed ‘Minced Venison wrapped in Savoy Cabbage leaves in a Sweet and Sour Sauce)  was equally successful. \The easy availability of shellfish and my very American ways of preparing them, using cockles in chowder, or making crab cakes in many ways particular to their American locales: Louisiana, Baltimore, New England, meant that I was able to introduce new ways of eating familiar things. Bernard’s knowledge of smoking fish meant that we experimented, then produced, palatable smoked mussels.</p><p></p><p>We were close enough to the harbour for the local fishermen to find the way to our nack door. We told them to use the front door, especially if customers were there. We were able to get our vegetables directly from the field in Overy Staithe which had been used by the hotel. Local wildfowlers brought us a steady supply of pigeons. We had local venison, eggs from Overy Staithe and even a friend who supplied us, during all the time we were there, with quirky and wonderful ice cream.</p><p></p><p>Our suppliers became friends, as did many customers and most of our staff. Most of our children had the experience of working hard alongside us, which was of great benefit in their later life. But, the long hours and physical strain of standing in small spaces for hours on end was poor for our health. Bernard became very ill. We had to give up. Happily we were able to find a new home in this town which had truly supported us.</p><p></p><p>When we had settled into our new home on the High Street, ‘The Quay’, the Wells monthly magazine, was started. Bernard was its first editor. From its beginnings to the present I have continued to share my recipes in it – some from my catering past, others from my childhood, and  some recently encountered, all using ingredients which are locally obtainable and which can be made at home using perfectly ordinary equipment. And so, the catering connections of the Phillips family continue on.  </p><p>                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>   </p></body></html>
