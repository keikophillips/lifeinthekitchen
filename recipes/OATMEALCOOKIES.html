<body><p>OATMEAL COOKIES – THIN AND CRISP</p><p></p><p>For years I’ve been searching for a plain, large oatmeal biscuit, simply flavoured and with good lasting quality whenstored in a tin. This one is very pleasing, served with ice cream or stewed fruit, and it’s good on its own, served with a cup of coffee or tea, Easy to make, using the ‘all in one’ method, in a single mixing bowl, The batter spreads, so that the biscuits must be set well-apart on large-ish baking sheets, lined with Bakewell or greaseproof paper. </p><p>Ingredients: 140g plain flour; ¾ tsp baking powder; ½ tsp baking soda (bicarb); ½ tsp salt; 200g butter, at room temperature; 170g caster sugar; 40g light brown sugar; 1 egg; 1 tsp vanilla extract; 190g rolled oats.</p><p>Method: First, cream the butter and the sugars. Then, stir in the flour,baking powder, bicarb and salt. \then add in the egg, vanilla and last of all, the oats. With a tablespoon, form into little balls, and place,well apart on the baking sheets. Press them slightly in the middle, to about a ¾ inch thickness. Bake them in a hottish (290-200) oven for about 13 minutes. Cool then on the baking sheets before transferring them to a wire rack. Store in tins – almost indefinitely.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
