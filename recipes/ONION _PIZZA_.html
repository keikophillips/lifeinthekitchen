On the other hand, it is extremely cheap. Once made and cut into little squares or oblongs, it’s ready to be handed round with a drink or three. </p><p>Ingredients: 1 tsp dried yeast, 1 tblesp warm water; a pinch of sugar; 150g strong white flour; 50g brown (wholemeal) flour; 2 tblsp olive oil; 60ml water. For the topping: 600g onions, thinly sliced;2 tbls olive oil; a branch of thyme; salt and pepper; a little grated parmesan; dash of cayenne</p><p></p><p>Method: Add a small pinch of sugar to a tablespoon of warm water then soak the dried yeast in it. Leave five minutes, it should be slightly foamy. Then combine the two flours and salt. At the yeast mixture, the two tablespoons of olive oil and the water to the flour and knead the dough. If it seems dry and unyielding, add more water. All flours have different water content so it is hard to be precise. Now oil the dough lightly and place it in a bowl, cover with either film or a tea towel, then leave to rise for 1and ½ hours in a warmish place. Meanwhile make the topping. For this, heat up a large frying pan. Tip the sliced onions directly onto the hot, dry pan along with the thyme branch. Stir whilst they steam. When they are just starting to colour, add the olive oil, salt and pepper. Stir well, then lower the heat and allow the onions to cook until they are brown, caramelised, stirring occasionally. Then remove from the heat. When cool enough to handle, remove the thyme stem – the leaves will have blended in.</p><p>To bake, you need a couple of baking sheets or trays, or large pizza tins. You also need to preheat your oven to a very high temperature. </p><p>So, divide your dough. On a floured surface, roll it out very, very thinly. This dough is not at all ‘short’ so that you can be daring! Place each half of dough, thinly rolled out, on each of your baking sheets. Then divide up your onions and spread them lightly over each dough.. Finally, sprinkle with a little grated parmesan and a dash of cayenne and leave to rise for ½ hour.</p><p>Place them in a very hot oven for about 10-12 minutes. The edges should be quite brown. Remove from the oven, then allow to cool slightly. To cut, use a pizza wheel, sharp knife or kitchen scissors.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                   -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
