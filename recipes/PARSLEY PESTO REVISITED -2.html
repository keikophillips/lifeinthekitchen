<body><p>PARSLEY PESTO REVISITED-2</p><p></p><p>We’re in the ‘Hungry Gap’, a period of time when relatively few local vegetables are readily available- except for the recent, glorious presence of asparagus. This is a time when there is a good presence of various  brassica: kales, sprouting broccoli, cauliflowers. But our appetites can flag faced with these if we don’t occasionally titivate them somewhat, so I am reminding you of this Italian sauce which nicely complements these greens. You can cook these in an economical way. By putting the chopped greens into a boiling pot of water and pasta for the last 4-5 minutes of cooking, then draining it all together before immersing it in the ‘pesto’. This particular ‘winter pesto’ with easily obtained ingredients, should delight you, and if you’re only cooking the greens on their own, they will taste marvellous when strewn with this magical mixture.</p><p>Ingredients: 25g walnuts; 12g garlic, peeled; 50g grated parmesan;50 g parsley; 50ml olive oil; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Either in a food processor or stick blender crush the garlic, walnuts, parsley and parmesan together, then add the olive oil gradually. Season to taste. This will store in the fridge for a week or two.</p><p>                                                                                         -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
