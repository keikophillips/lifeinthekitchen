<html><body><p>WINTER PESTO</p><p></p><p>Ordinary pesto is a sauce made with basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil and parmesan cheese. Often bought in jars, it’s handy on pasta. Outside the growing season for basil, this sauce, a winter ‘poesto’ comes into its own. In our restaurant, we spooned a little over a mixture of cooked broccoli and cauliflour. Nowadays, I serve it with pasta – it’s really popular with grandchildren – and continue to serve it with broccoli or sprouting broccoli, I slip the prepared broccoli into the boiling pasta for the last four minutes of its cooking time, saving, therefore on energy or additional saucepans.</p><p>Winter pasta’s proper name is ‘Salsa di Prezzamolo con Noci’ (this really brought out the red underlines on my computer) . As well as parsley, it calls for walnuts, which are a Fairtrade ingredient (it’s that time of year again). If you leave out the cheese, and store it covered with a fine coat of olive oil it will last quite a while in y our fridge.</p><p>Ingredients: 50g walnuts; 25g garlic; 100g parsley; 100g grated parmesan; 100ml olive oil; salt and pepper</p><p>Method: Either chop together by hand or process the garlic and parsley with some salt and pepper. Chop or grind the walnuts (or add to the processor) and blend all together. Trickle in the olive oil. Store this in a jar, in your fridge. If you wish, you can titivate it  by adding a little cream when you serve it, but I don’t think this is really necessary.</p><p></p><p>                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p><p>                                                                                                                                           </p></body></html>
