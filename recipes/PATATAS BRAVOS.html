There’s now a wet fish shop on Staithe Street, and very fine it looks, too. </p><p>The shop became vacant when Jules Jackson of ‘Delish’ moved to a purpose built factory unit nearer Norwich, in order to make his bespoke pates and charcuterie for a wider public. (Much of his produce is now available at the terrific delicatessen further up Staithe Street).</p><p>Meanwhile, Arthur Howell’s fish shop looks splendid and has a good selection of fish and shellfish, including fish pie mixture and the crabs and lobsters caught and prepared by the Frary family. Later on the shop will be stocking the Frary’s mussels.</p><p>Occasionally they have truly locally caught fish, including my favourite grey mullet. Cherished and valued in Southern Italy and Greece, grey mullet are slightly scorned here.</p><p>Why? Caught in the same places frequented by bass and sea trout, these fish are not awkwardly boned, or difficult to deal with. Their nail-shell type scales are easily scraped off the fish with the back of a blunt table knife. There is a tad more oil in them than a common flatfish, but that only adds to the general juiciness of their taste.</p><p>Filleted, or if a large fish, steaked, they are relatively inexpensive. Dribbled with a little olive oil, well seasoned, with a herb or two added, they can be wrapped in foil, then roasted for approximately ten minutes.  The following recipe for ‘Patatas Bravas’ is particularly nice served with simply prepared grey mullet – and cold, are equally harmonious.</p><p>Ingredients (for 2): 300g small potatoes – new or newish are best; 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil; 1 large clove of garlic, minced; 1-2 chillies, de-seeded and chopped; a pinch of dried cumin; a teaspoon of paprika; a red pepper, finely sliced; a tablespoon of vinegar; salt.</p><p>Method: Scrub the potatoes, place them in salted water and bring them to the boil. Boil for only ten minutes. Then drain them and cut them into chunks. Now heat a large frying pan. Pour in the olive oil and when it is hot, add the potatoes. Fry them turning occasionally, until they turn golden brown.</p><p>Meanwhile, crush the garlic, chillies, cumin and paprika together with the vinegar.(A processor or mortar and pestle are best for this). When the potatoes are brown, add this together with the sliced pepper and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Salt the potatoes (Coarse salt is particularly nice for this) and serve. This is good hot, cold, or reheated!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                            -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
