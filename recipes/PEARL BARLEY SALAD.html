<body><p>PEARL BARLEY SALAD</p><p></p><p>Easy to prepare, without the health risks entailed by presenting a rice salad at room temperature during warmish weather, this simple salad is a quick and decorative way to use up leftovers, </p><p>To cook pearl barley, boil 100g in about 600ml of lightly salted water. This takes around 30 minutes. Once it has swelled and been drained, itâ€™s ready to handle.</p><p>Cut up cooked vegetables: peppers; sweet corn; beans (broad and green); courgettes; peas; carrots. Slice, into fine chunks, some solid little cherry tomatoes and a small portion of cucumber. Mix these well into the barley, then add plenty of greenery: parsley; mint; dill; chives. Mix it well, season, then add a lemony vinaigrette. Mix well again before decorating it with a final sprinkling of parsley.</p><p>This is a good accompaniment to cold leftovers, and can also accompany a simple green salad. </p><p></p><p>                                                                                              -Carla Phillips</p><p>                  </p></body></html>
