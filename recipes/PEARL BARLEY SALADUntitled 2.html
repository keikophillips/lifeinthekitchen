<body><p>PEARL BARLEY SALAD</p><p></p><p>Easy to cook and without the health risks entailed by presenting a rice salad at room temperature during warmish weather, this salad is a quick and tasty way to use up leftovers. Pearl barley is inexpensive and easily cooked. 100G in 600ml lightly salted water- then boiled around a half hour until the grains have swelled. Once drained, it is ready to handle.</p><p>Cut into small pieces bits of already cooked vegetables – beans (broad , green and runner), peas (I used frozen); cooked carrots, courgettes, peppers, sweet corn. Slice some small, firm cherry tomatoes into small bits, likewise, some cucumber. Mix these all into the barley, then add plenty of greenery: parsley; mint; dill; chives…</p><p>Now add a lemony vinaigrette, salt and pepper. Mix well, correct the seasoning, and if it seems slightly bland, add a drop more lemon juice, Finally, sprinkle with more parsley. </p><p></p><p>                                                                   -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
