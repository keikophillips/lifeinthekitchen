<body><p>“PETIT SUISSE “ ENGLISH STYLE</p><p></p><p>Living in France, many, many years ago, this was a delicious cream which was served with summer fruits: sliced strawberries, raspberries, gently softened and stewed apricots or plums...A dollop accompanied each portion of fruit. It was served  at home, and also in restaurants. Even though it was widely sold in tiny packets it was simple to make at home. Once it is prepared, it will keep well covered and refrigerated for 3 or 4 days.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: a small carton of ricotta cheese; a pinch of salt; 150ml of double cream; 2 0r 3 teaspoons of icing sugar.</p><p>Method: Mix the ricotta with the pinch of salt and the icing sugar. \add the cream and whip it all until stiff, Chill before serving it with the fruit.</p><p>                                                                                        -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
