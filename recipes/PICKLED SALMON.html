<body><p>PICKLED  “LOX”</p><p></p><p></p><p>This dish was my father’s favourite. Unfortunately, my mother disliked cooking oily fish so he had to go out to a local Russian Jewish ‘dairy’ restaurant in order to indulge. I accompanied him, so was introduced to salmon, which I now adore.</p><p></p><p>I tried to duplicate it for many years. But, on my last visit to New York a few years ago, I sampled the version sold by a very famous delicatessen. It wasn’t quite right, but I realised just what I needed to perfect my own version of this great Russian dish.</p><p></p><p>The ‘cooking’ is done through pickling – in vinegar, sugar and salt. It isn’t too light a pickle so that, like Gravlax, it will last for about a fortnight. Any sort of salmon: wild; farmed; organic, can be used. But it must be skinned, filleted and have the pin bones removed. If the fish monger or the attendant at the fish counter will not do this, just run your hand down the middle part of the fillet. The few protruding tiny bones, which you feel, are easily removed with tweezers.</p><p></p><p>This dish is ideal for parties. The given amount of pickling fluid will suffice, whether you are dealing with a half kilo of fish or three times as much. Only the amount of salt will vary.  So, in order to make one of the most requested of my recipes, here goes!</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: ½ -1 ½ kg salmon fillet, cut into generous bite sized chunks; 2 rounded teaspoons (per ½ kg of fish) of salt; 2-3 tablespoons of sugar; 1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced into half-rounds; 1 large carrot, very thinly sliced. Use a potato peeler for this.; 1 teaspoon of pickling spice; 1 teaspoon of whole peppercorns; a handful or chopped fresh dill or a good sprinkling of freeze dried dill; ½ litre of good cider vinegar. Whin Hill from Wells is ideal.</p><p></p><p>Method: Put the chunks of salmon into a bowl and sprinkle the salt over them. Spread the chunks on a cake rack to air and dry slightly while you prepare the pickle.</p><p>Combine the vinegar, sugar, peppercorns and pickling spice with the sliced onion and carrot. Bring this to the boil, then reduce to a very gentle simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, pour into a cooler jug or bowl and cool this as quickly as you can, by plunging this container into a larger bowl full of cold water. When this liquid is quite tepid, distribute the salmon chunks into a wide, low dish which has a cover (plastic versions are readily obtainable). Pour the pickling fluid over the fish chunks, then add the dill. Cover and leave in your fridge for at least 48 hours. It is then ready, and, I hope you agree, truly delicious!</p></body></html>
