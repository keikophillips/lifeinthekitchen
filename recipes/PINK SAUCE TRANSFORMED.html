<body><p>PINK SAUCE TRANSFORMED</p><p></p><p>Usually, I plan to make one or two things to tide me over a week: a soup or a vegetable casserole, perhaps a salad with varied ingredients, some cooked. When I am limited for time, or with lack of ambition, I simply supplement these with either a sandwich, baked potatoes or simple pasta, an omelette or something fishy or shell fishy, requiring no cooking.  Thus, I am furnished with one decent meal each day.</p><p>If I have some prawns, peeled shrimp, crab, cold cooked fish, I know that there’s enough for a decent salad or sandwich. Accompanied by bright, light pink sauce, ‘Marie Rose’, It’s quite a treat.</p><p>That sauce can be quickly titivated into  something grander. In New York Irish bars, when they serve prawns (or as they call them ‘shrimps’) they add a little bottled horseradish sauce to the mayonnaise-ketchup mixture. Very pleasant indeed!</p><p>But, experimenting with the tiny jar of ‘White Miso’ I bought last week at Tesco, I discovered something even better. To the standard sauce of one tablespoon of mayo to which I’ve added a single teaspoon of ketchup, I also added a single teaspoon of that miso. Now, miso is a Japanese condiment and the white variety is made from fermented bean curd. Other, darker misos are made from fermented rice or wheat. These are all particularly rich in ‘Umami’ - which means a savoury taste. Other examples include parmesan cheese, very well aged cheddar,  Thai fish sauce, anchovy essence…. You may get an idea of what this adds up to. </p><p>Anyway, add a little miso to your pink sauce and it will be elevated to the food for the gods. Try it, and see what you think.</p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
