<body><p>PIZZA DOUGH</p><p></p><p>This is a mainstay of my cooking. It’s a dough which lasts, when wrapped in a plastic bag, for up to 3 weeks in the fridge. It has multiple uses, beyond pizza- a reasonable dough for quiches, and rolled thinly, a terrific wrapping for sausage rolls. It is not necessary, with this dough, to grease or oil the baking tin or sheet, It’s simple to prepare, and the result is tasty.</p><p>Ingredients: 7g dried yeast (1 teaspoon); 280g strong white flour; 70g strong brown flour; 10g salt; 50ml olive oil; water and a tiny pinch of sugar.</p><p>First of all, soak the yeast in 100ml of lightly warm, slightly sweetened water. Leave this for at least 10 minutes – it should be foamy. Then mix together the flours and salt, in a large bowl. Add the yeasty water to this and then, the olive oil. Add enough water to this to make a soft and pliable dough. Knead this together until it is smooth and flexible. If you have a dough hook on a mixer or a processor with a very strong motor, you can use this, but in any case, this shouldn’t take too long.</p><p>With oiled hands form the dough into a ball, place it in a clean bowl, and leave, covered with a tea towel or sheet of cling film, undisturbed for 2-3 hours, to rise.  Then, knock it back. It is ready for use, either now, or stored in a plastic bad in the fridge. When you use it, roll it very, very thinly – if you are worried that it may split, it can be rolled over a large piece of clingfilm, and then placed on a baking sheet. </p><p>If you are using this dough for sausage rolls, brush it with a little beaten egg before filling the dough with sausage meat. Seal it and coat it with a little more beaten egg, and the outside will appear nicely glossy.</p><p>The thinner the dough is rolled, the crisper and finer the result. Top with your favourite pizza toppings, and bake in a very hot oven, for 10-15 minutes.</p><p>When used after being refrigerated, leave it to reach room temperature before topping or filling….</p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips </p><p>  </p></body></html>
