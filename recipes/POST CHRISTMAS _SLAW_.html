There’s nothing so cheering as a plate or two of sliced up remains, a jar or two of homemade chutney or some sauce, perhaps a baked potato – and a salad or two to accompany it all. I have recently invented a sort of ‘slaw’, a mixture with oriental overtones which is totally suitable for these occasions.</p><p>It uses the Japanese mooli. That is the long white radish which is easily found nowadays. I’ve been buying them regularly from a Fakenham vegetable stall on market day, but wouldn’t be surprised to see them even more widely available. Not expensive, the mooli is long lasting, kept in the fridge. A slice or two will substitute for turnips in any casserole or soup. Sliced thinly and sauteed, they are delicious.</p><p>They’re good in stirfries. Grated or julienned they are wonderful in salads. As in this recipe.</p><p>The quantity given here is sufficient for 5-6 portions. It lasts for 4-5 days, refrigerated.</p><p>Ingredients: 100g mooli, grated or julienned; 100g carrots, roughly grated; 100g onion (preferably red, for appearance) very finely sliced; 70g red peppers, sliced into very fine slivers; a handful of fresh coriander; a handful of parsley, both finely chopped. </p><p>Dressing: The juice of 2 fresh limes; 1 tablespoon of sugar; 1 tablespoon of soy sauce; 1 chilli, deveined, deseeded and very finely minced; 100g mayonnaise; salt and pepper to taste.</p><p>Method: Combine the chopped vegetables and herbs and mix them sell. Then whisk together the dressing ingredients, and pour over the salad. Leave it to chill and mature in the fridge for a few hours before serving. It’s even better, the second day.</p><p>Happy Christmas!</p><p>                                                                           -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
