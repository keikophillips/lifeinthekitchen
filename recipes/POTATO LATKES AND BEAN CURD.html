<body><p>TWO RECIPES FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS</p><p></p><p>POTATO LATKE</p><p></p><p>This is what both of my grandmothers made with potatoes in the very early spring. They are not really at their best, but they can be made into nice, filling things. Known as ‘latkes’ or ‘latkas’, there are equivalent recipes all over eastern Europe. I’ve been making these a long, long time. So here’s a recipe which will serve one very, very hungry person or two ordinary souls.</p><p>For one very large potato, well scrubbed but unpeeled, you need half of a medium onion, one egg, salt and pepper and at least a heaping tablespoon of plain flour, as well as a little vegetable oil for frying.</p><p>First of all, grate the potato, skin and all. You can use either a fine or coarse grater for this; the effect is different, and the fine grater will give you a more ‘cakelike’ effect. </p><p>Anyway, grate the potato into a fine sieve, then manually squeeze out any excess fluid. Place it in a bowl, and grate the onion half, fine grater this time, into it. Mix them well together, season well with salt and pepper, then add the egg and stir. Last of all, add in the flour. </p><p>Heat the frying pan and coat it with a little oil. When this is very hot, dollop in tablespoons of the mixture. Allow to cook for several minutes, until brown, before turning it over to cook the other side.</p><p>These are delicious served with apple puree which has been slightly sweetened, then sharpened with a teaspoon or so of hot horseradish sauce. But you can also serve these simply with a fried egg, for a good and warming supper.</p><p></p><p>Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>BEAN CURD</p><p></p><p>Bland, dead white, limp and almost jelly like, I never could see what bean curd (tofu) had to offer. However, one evening in a Chinese restaurant, I was served the traditional family favourite: Ma Po Bean Curd, as part of a feast and I had to eat my words. This is a spicy and comforting dish containing a very little minced beef, a few mushrooms and lots of Chinese seasonings and spices (it’s not hot, but very tasty).  The bean curd stretches the other ingredients into a supremely successful classic dish. There are recipes for it in most Chinese cookbooks, and it really changed my mind. </p><p>After trying Hot and Sour soup, another Chinese dish, then some Thai curries- I’ve now decided that it’s versatile and when used with strong contrasting textures and tastes, is a fine thing to use. It’s widely available, even here in Wells as well as at Oriental groceries and food stalls. Here is a dish which is successful when hot or warm, but makes a tasty cold salad for following meals.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 packet of tofu; a tablespoon or so of cornflour, seasoned with salt and pepper; 1 red pepper, finely sliced into thin strips; 2-3 spring onions, sliced; vegetable oil for frying. For the sauce: the juice of 2 fresh limes; 1 or 2 chillies, finely chopped (seeds in or not, depending upon your taste); 2 chopped cloves of garlic; a walnut sized piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated;1 tablespoon of soy sauce; a handful of fresh coriander, chopped.</p><p>Method: Spread the seasoned cornflour on a flat dish. Unwrap the bean curd then drain it well on a couple of slices of kitchen towel before slicing it into squares. Heat up the oil (there should be about 2cm, ½ inch of it in the pan), then tip the floured curd into the hot oil. Wait until the curd is starting to colour up and crust slightly before turning in the hot fat. When they are coloured and crispish, remove from the heat, and drain on some more kitchen paper before turning into a bowl. Add the pepper slices to the hot fat, then the spring onions, and fry, brifly. Remove, then add to the bean curd. Now make the sauce by combining with garlic, chilli, and ginger with the lime juice and soy sauce. Toss this over the bean curd mixture, then throw in the coriander. Season well, then serve.</p><p></p><p>                                                               -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
