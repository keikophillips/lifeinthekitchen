<body><p>POTATO SALAD FRENCH STYLE</p><p></p><p>Newly wed, living and working in Paris in the early 1960’s, this was a treat from our local ‘charcuterie’.  It was called ‘Salad Piemontaise’. Recently, looking up the name on the net, most French recipes call for slices or chunks of cooked ham, rather than tuna- so if that suits you, you can substitute one for the other; It is especially good when new potatoes are easily available.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 300g new potatoes; 30g finely chopped onion; 1 tin of tuna steak (preferably one in olive oil, though sunflower oil will do as well); 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar; a tablespoon each of capers, chopped gherkins, chopped parsley and mayonnaise; salt and pepper.</p><p></p><p>Method: Scrub the potatoes well and immerse them in a saucepan with water to cover. If you wish, you can either add mint or a bay leaf. Salt the water, Cover the saucepan and bring it to the boil. |Cook until the potatoes are tender, then drain and leave to cool. Now chop the onion and combine it with the cooked potato, a little salt and the wine vinegar. Now add the tuna, its oil, and toss well. Add the capers, gherkins and then the mayonnaise. Taste – you may need a little more vinegar or mayonnaise. Season with salt and pepper and last of all add the chopped parsley.</p><p>You can add cooked cold vegetables to this: asparagus, green beans, peeled broad beans, even a little samphire. This is a good starter or lunch dish.</p><p>                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
