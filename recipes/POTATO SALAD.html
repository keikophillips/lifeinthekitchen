<body><p>POTATO SALADS</p><p></p><p>New potatoes are such a treat. Washed, scraped and then cooked till they are tender, they need very little adornment. The standard English manner of adding a few leaves of fresh mint to their cooking water is very successful.</p><p>If you are making a potato salad, it’s a good idea to marinate the freshly cooked, hot potatoes in a mixture of grated onion (about a dessertspoonful), along with salt, pepper and a tablespoonful or two of cider vinegar. Don’t drown the potatoes in this mixture. Just too then in enough of it for them to be lightly coated and then leave them to cool.</p><p>If you are serving them with many other sauced ingredients, you can simply dress them with a little olive oil and a few fresh herbs.</p><p>For a fully dressed potato salad, you can add a mixture of chopped capers and gherkins. Finally add a small amount of mayonnaise and a similar quantity of yoghurt. Finish them off with some chopped parsley, with or without some dill. This last salad is wonderful served with plain cold fish – smoked mackerel, cold salmon, or shellfish – or  tinned tuna. A nice summery feast.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                       -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
