<body><p>TART AUX PRUNEAUX –PRUNE TART</p><p></p><p>This recipe kept coming up every time I looked up recipes typifying northern French cookery, whether in books or online. So, finally I decided to try it out before simply dismissing it out-of-hand. The pastry, made with yeast, is not especially rich and is surprisingly simple to make, even if, like most yeast pastry, it does take time. But it doesn’t require hard work.</p><p>This yeast pastry is widely used in northern France and Belgium, topped with all sorts of fresh fruit in season, then dusted with sugar and butter. But this popular combination struck me as unusual, inexpensive, rewarding.</p><p>It makes a large tart, so use either a large springform pan or a pizza tray or tin. It can be made very easily in a mixer or food processor but it’s quick and simple to do without any of these bits of machinery.</p><p>Ingredients: For the pastry: 1 packet of fast action yeast; 50ml milk; 240 g ‘strong’ flour; 1 egg, lightly beaten; 50g butter, melted; 50g sugar; pinch of cinnamon; pinch of salt. For the filling: 230g pitted prunes; 150ml water; 80g sugar; small bit of cinnamon stick (2 inches or 5cm); 1 tablespoon of brandy; 1 dessertspoon of extra sugar.</p><p>Method: First of all heat themilk gently in a small saucepan until it’s slightly warmer than body temperature. Remove from the heat, then stir in the yeast. Melt the butter and leave to cool slightly while you assemble the dry ingredients. Combine the flour, sugar, pinches of cinnamon and salt. {Place them in the bowl of the mixer or processor}. Combine the ‘wet’ ingredients – that is, the egg, milk and yeast, the butter, and then beat them into the flour. Keep on beating or mixing them until you have ball which sticks together. Knead this very briefly, then place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover this with either a tea towel or cling film and leave for an hour in a warmish place.</p><p>Meanwhile, make the filling. Do this by combining the prunes, water, sugar and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Bring it to the boil and then simmer slowly until the prunes are very soft and most of the water has been absorbed. Then remove the cinnamon stick, either mash or blitz the prunes, and add the tablespoon of brandy.</p><p>After the dough has risen, lightly butter and flour your baking tin. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and then place it on the tin. Prick the dough all over with a fork, and leave it for another 20 minutes. Preheat your oven to a medium hot temperature. Dollop the puree onto the dough, then smooth it out leaving some plain pastry edging. Sprinkle the dessertspoon of sugar over this filling, then bake it for 20 minutes, until the edges are golden. </p><p>It’s served lukewarm, dusted with icing sugar, accompanied by crème fraiche.</p><p>                                                                                                                            -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
