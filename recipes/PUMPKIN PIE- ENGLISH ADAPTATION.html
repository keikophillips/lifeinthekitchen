<body><p>THAT ALL AMERICAN FAVOURITE</p><p></p><p>While pumpkins are used in this country for soup or a roasted vegetable medley, any American will proclaim them the Star of the Show at Thanksgiving. A favourite of mine, I think that the simplest Yankee recipe is the best; rich additions of cream, alcohol, boozy fruit doing no favours for this delicious pudding. </p><p>In the States, pumpkin usually comes in tins; here we have to start from scratch, with the raw pumpkin. So, split a smallish  pumpkin (say, around a kilo) in half, scoop out the seeds and fibrous bits, and roast it in a very lightly oiled tin, flat side down, for 40-60 minutes in a moderate oven until the flesh is soft when prodded. Scoop out the flesh into a bowl.</p><p>Blind bake some shortcrust pastry in a 23cm(9 inch) pie dish. (I make a very short pastry using 160g flour, 100g butter and a pinch of salt. Refrigerate for an hour before rolling out.)</p><p>Now, for the pie filling: Ingredients: 350-425 g cooked pumpkin;2 eggs; 1 tin of evaporated milk (NOT the supersweet condensed milk); ½ teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon; ½ teaspoon ground ginger; ¼ teaspoon ground cloves; 170g caster sugar.</p><p>Method: Blitz together all these ingredients until smooth. Use a blender, processor or stick blender for speed. Pour into the baked pastry shell and bake in a moderate oven for 25 minutes, then lower the heat and bake for a further 10-15 minutes, until the pie filling has set. Serve either warm or cold, with thick or whipped cream.</p><p>If your pumpkin is large and watery, you may have to drain it in a colander for an hour or two before starting to use it. And if you have too much pumpkin, you can either refrigerate it for up to five days, then make another pie, or freeze it in batches. Or, you can simply stir plain cooked pumpkin into a leek and potato soup.Without altering the taste substantially,it will turn the most appetizing looking pale orange colour!</p><p>                                                                                   -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
