<body><p>PUMPKIN PIE</p><p></p><p>November is the month of that great American festival, Thanksgiving. No matter how many attempts are made to cheapen it with commercial nonsense, it manages to remain a great time of coming together with family and great friends, a happy feast, untainted (unlike Christmas, alas) of massive commercialism.</p><p>Like English Christmas, turkey is the dish of the day, though the ‘sides’ are different. Pumpkin Pie is the dessert of choice, My version is the most basic, most popular version of it all. Not containing alcohol, cream or anything exotic, it still seems to me to be the best recipe of all.</p><p>Start with a small pumpkin. Dense, less work, with more flavour, they are infinitely more useful than bigger ones which are fine for soup. Halve it, deseed it then bake it, face down in a hottish oven until soft and mushy. Remove it from the liquid (it’s an ooazer), and scoop the cooked flesh out of each half, and drain it, in a fine strainer, or any strainer lined with a clean J-cloth, to get rid of any excess fluid. Then, it’s ready for use – or for freezing, should you wish.</p><p>The rest is easy. Plain sailing.</p><p>Ingredients: a blind baked pastry crust. Use the deepest pie tin you have.; 400-430 g pumpkin flesh; 2 eggs, lightly beaten; 175 g sugar; ½ tsp salt; 1 tsp ground cinnamon; ½ tsp ground ginger; ¼ tsp ground cloves (a little pinch); 1 tin of evaporated milk.  Oven temp- medium (350’).</p><p>Method: Mix the pumpkin and all other ingredients together, pour them into the pie shell and bake for 40-50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes up clean. Serve with cream or ice cream.</p><p></p><p>                                       - Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
