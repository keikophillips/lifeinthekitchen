They breed like- well, rabbits! They are very available, cheap, wild, probably organic, lean, and small enough to do nicely for a couple of meals for two. And this dish, when cold, that is- leftover, is really delectable, accompanied by bread and a simple green salad. Hot, I recommend serving it with mash and one of the slightly bitter brassicas: sprouting broccoli or calabrese.</p><p>Ingredients: A rabbit, cut up into joints; 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil; a handful of rosemary; 2 cloves of garlic,peeled then cut in half; 2 glasses of vermouth or other dry white wine; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Use either a heavy lidded casserole or start with a frying pan, then transfer the contents to a lidded baking casserole. First heat the olive oil. Soften the cut cloves of garlic in the hot oil and when they start to brown, remove them. Add the rabbit pieces, frying them until they are coloured but not brown. Season well with salt and pepper. Then add the rosemary and both glasses of vermouth. Bring it to the boil, then either cover the casserole and simmer it at a low temperature covered for and hour and a half to two hours, or place it in a low oven for the same time. Last of all, remove the rabbit pieces to a serving dish while you furiously boil down to remaining juices to thicken the sauce somewhat (this should not take more than 5 minutes). Check the seasoning before serving.</p><p>                                                                       -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
