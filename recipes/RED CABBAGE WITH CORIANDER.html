<body><p>RED CABBAGE WITH CORIANDER</p><p></p><p>Before she worked for us, Jane, my helper in our restaurant, spent ten years in Cyprus. This recipe , which she got from her landlady, became a staple which we served throughout a great deal of the year. We substituted cider and cider vinegar for the white wine which her landlady had used, as it was local and cheaper, and to my mind, just as good. The dish takes a bit of time to assemble, but not much physical effort and is even better, reheated on the second day.</p><p> Ingredients: Â½ of a medium sized red cabbage, shredded; 1 large finely sliced onion; 1 tablsp olive oil; 1 tblsp coriander seeds, crushed ( whacked while contained in a paper bag); a wineglass of dry cider; a wineglass of cider vinegar; 2-3 tablsp brown sugar; 1 cooking apple, finely chopped; 2 tsp sultanas; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Heat up a heavy-bottomed saucepan, and add the olive oil. Sweat the shredded cabbage and the onions in it, stirring, for about five minutes. Then add the crushed coriander into the mix, stirring it in, and cooking it for a few minutes. Now, add the cider and the cider vinegar. Stir it well, reducing the cooking liquid slightly, and then add the sugar, chopped apple. Sultanas, salt and pepper.. Cook this, stirring occasionally for at least a quarter of an hour, possibly longer if the cabbage seems tough. Correct the seasoning to suit yourself, adding more vinegar, salt, sugar, etc to suit your taste. </p><p>This is good as an added vegetable for a main meal, but is also a great accompaniment to sausage, bacon or a pork chop, or simply served on its own with simple boiled potatoes and a little hot mustard.</p><p>                                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
