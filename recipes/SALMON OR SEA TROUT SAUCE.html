<body><p>SALMON OR SEA TROUT, A LOVELY SAUCE</p><p></p><p>I can’t remember where or when in the wilds of my past I first tried out this fine accompaniment for sea trout or salmon. This is easily made, requiring almost no cooking at all as it is a simple assemblage of readily available ingredients. It can be served with hot fish, or cooled down, with a large cooked salmon or sea trout, which makes it an ideal companion if you’re cooking a big fish for a feast.</p><p>However, served simply with cooked steaks or slices of fillet, together with simple steamed new potatoes and some slightly astringent and green broccoli, sprouting broccoli or calabrese – Well! Find me something better! I dare you!</p><p>As for cooking salmon or sea trout – it’s always a matter of not overcooking your fish to the point of dryness. If the fish is to be served as steaks or slices, I salt it ten minutes before cooking, sprinkle it with a little parsley, then steam it for a very few minutes, leaving it to ‘rest’ and finish cooking as soon as it has changed colour. But if it’s a big fish, wrapping it in foil may be fine, or cooking it in a fish kettle, or even using the microwave. If it’s fresh and fine, you can’t go wrong. So, here’s the recipe for the sauce.</p><p>Ingredients: 2 large, dollopy tablespoons of mayonnaise (yes, bottled mayo will do-); a walnut-sized piece of fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated; 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard; a dessertspoon of sugar; a dessertspoon of white wine vinegar; the zest of a smallish orange; the juice of the same orange; 2 heaping tablespoons of soured cream; 2 teaspoons of drained green peppercorns.</p><p>Method: Combine all these in a saucepan and leave to stand 15 minutes. Then heat this gently, briefly (otherwise it will curdle and separate), Serve, warm or cold with your cooked fish.</p><p></p><p>                                                             -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
