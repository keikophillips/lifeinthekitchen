<body><p>070630 Cooking with Carla</p><p></p><p>Samphire with Green Sauce</p><p></p><p>July and early August are the best times for samphire, which grows profusely along our coastline, part of a chain of plants which attach the salty earth to the tidal mud. It’s on sale at fish shops, as well as at our beloved seafood stall on the quay, run by the Frary family.</p><p>The beautiful samphire you buy from the Frarys has been well washed, but if you do pick some yourself, try not to uproot too much of it because the roots are fulfilling a valuable ecological function. It must be washed very thoroughly to remove any mud, then either placed in the basket of a steamer or stood, roots side down, asparagus fashion, in a few inches of boiling water. Cover and cook briskly for at least seven minutes. Later in the season, it will need more time.</p><p>To test if it is done, pull a strand from the pot, run it under cold water then see if the green flesh slips easily away from its stringy stalk.</p><p>If done, remove from the heat and immerse briefly in cold water to prevent further cooking.</p><p>For easy eating, detach all the green flesh from the stalks. It should look like a brilliant green sort of pasta which drapes dramatically wherever it is laid.</p><p>I love to serve it with the following sauce which is also superb with asparagus, globe artichokes, green bans, any left-over veg and hard-boiled eggs.</p><p>INGREDIENTS</p><p>70-100g of spinach or chard leaves. The “sea spinach” which can be picked locally is very good, but wash it well! </p><p>2/3 spring onions.</p><p>1 tablespoon of wine vinegar</p><p>A handful of green herbs: parsley, fennel (wild if you can find it locally), dill, chervil, tarragon – as many of these as you can find.</p><p>Two egg yolks</p><p>300-400g sunflower or ground nut oil</p><p>Salt and pepper</p><p>METHOD</p><p>Pour boiling water over the spinach. Drain well, then squeeze it dry. Combine it with the herbs, vinegar, spring onions and egg yolks in a blender. Blend  well, gradually adding the oil until you have a rich, brilliantly green sauce. Season to taste – but remember that the samphire is already naturally salty!</p></body></html>
