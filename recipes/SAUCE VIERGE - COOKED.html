<body><p>GLORIOUS SPRING</p><p></p><p>New green foliage, blossom everywhere, a little more warmth – and as a bonus, the first of the new season’s vegetables are here. Whether it’s asparagus, carrots, the first new potatoes, early broad beans – simply done, with the addition of  eggs, a little poached or steamed fish or chicken – are a great feast. Now, here’s a nicely savoury sauce to serve as an accompaniment.</p><p>I’m not at all sure what it is called. I’ve heard it referred to as ‘sauce vierge’ or ‘sauce provencale’ but a little research into Escoffier and other authorities hasn’t enlightened me any further. But it is delicious as a dipping or spooning sauce, and is easily prepared from readily available ingredients. It’s a sort of warm mayonnaise, and a bit like a hollandaise, using olive oil instead of melted butter. Once made, keep it barely warm in a bowl over but not immersed in hot water.</p><p>Ingredients: 1 crushed clove of garlic; 1 finely minced shallot; 1 small gherkins, very finely minced; a small handful of chopped parsley; 2 teaspoons of drained capers, chopped if large; 1 chilli, de-seeded, deveined and very finely chopped; 3-4 olives finely mashed; 3 anchovies, mashed; 2 egg yolks; 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar; a teacup of olive oil; a little ground black pepper.</p><p>Method: Combine the egg yolk and vinegar with all the ingredients except the olive oil. Then, in either the top of a double saucepan or in ma heavy small saucepan over a very, very low flame, stir these together and gradually add the olive oil, mayonnaise fashion, stirring well, until the sauce starts to thicken. Remove from the heat, lest it split. Keep it just warm,  and serve, in dollops with the fresh new vegetables, simply prepared, and anything else you choose to serve along with it.</p><p></p><p>                                                          -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
