<body><p>AN ITALIAN VARIATION</p><p></p><p>Some years ago I was part of a large crowd dining at a New York Pizzeria. While we all studied the menu, choosing variations which would please everyone present, we were brought a large plateful of these Italian sausage rolls.</p><p> They were delicious. The filling, savoury, herbed, slightly hot. The pastry, leftover </p><p>pizza dough,  not at all stodgy. When I returned home to Norfolk, I spent some time making my own version. So here it is- fine when hot with drinks or tea and fine, cold, for picnics.</p><p>Please don’t be intimidated by pastry made with yeast. Modern powdered yeast, widely available, makes this all an easy and trouble free procedure.</p><p>Ingredients: 225g strong flour; 75g wholemeal flour; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 packet instant yeast; 2 tablespoons olive oil; water.</p><p>Method: In a food processor, combine the flours, salt and yeast. Add the olive oil, then while whizzing it add enough water to form into a ball of dough. Continue to mix until it’s smooth and malleable. Place this dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it round to grease the whole surface. Then cover it with either a damp towel or clingfilm.Leave to rise for at least an hour and a half. </p><p>For the sausage filling- Ingredients:1/2kg sausage meat; 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds; 1 clove of garlic; ½ teaspoon of oregano; 1 chilli, deveined and deseeded.</p><p>Method: Combine the ingredients in a food processor. Form into long, skinny ‘chipolata’ sized sausage shapes and leave in the fridge till you’re ready to use them.</p><p>When the pastry has doubled in size, knock it down. For ease of handling, divide it into quarters or thirds. On a cool, floured surface, roll out one of these dough sections, rolling as thinly as you can. This dough is infinitely more elastic than shortcrust or puff pastry, so be bold!</p><p>Place one of the segments of sausage on the pastry and form it into a sausage roll, ‘glueing’ it together by pressing the dough firmly. Pinch the dough at the ends together, cut it, then place with the joined edge downwards on a baking sheet. Repeat until you’ve used up all your sausage meat. If you have any dough left over at the end, you can use it for a bonus pizza- wrapped in clingfilm, the dough will be fine in the fridge for a week.</p><p>Prick the pastry all over with a fork, leave to rise for 15-20 minutes, then bake in a very hot oven for 15 minutes, until golden brown. When they’re cooked, slice into serving sized segments.</p></body></html>
