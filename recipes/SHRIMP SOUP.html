<body><p>                                       SHRIMP SOUP</p><p></p><p>The little seaside stalls along our coast feature local delicacies: crabs, lobsters, little cupfuls of washed cockles, musses, whelks and winkles, brown and white shrimp. </p><p>I particularly like the small shrimp. They’re landed locally, fished off the Wash, boiled at sea in seawater with additional salt. This gives them their salty but satisfying savour.</p><p>Of course, it’s nice to eat them as is – breaking off the heads, then rapidly peeling off their shells. If there’s a fine black line of roe lining them, this is easily wiped off. I know it’s a fiddly job.But these little shrimp are the business as far as taste is concerned.</p><p>Now, if you’re willing to by a cupful  without devouring them on the spot, try using a saucepan as a receptacle for their leavings. Then, you'’e well on your way to preparing a soup fit for the Gods.</p><p>Once you have your saucepan of shrimp debris, and have refrigerated the edible fleshy bits, add to your saucepan a chopped up carrot, onion, celery blade, parsley stalk and a few peppercorns, along with a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree and a full glass of white wine. Any sort of white wine, and in a pinch, dry fine cider would do. Last of all, cover well with water (about 3 inches to spare on top of the solids). Bring to the boil, the reduce to a simmer (or leave in a gentle oven) for slightly longer than an hour.</p><p>Next, strain the stock through a fine sieve. If you like you can chill and freeze the stock for a super sauce for a fish dish or pie. But for my soup, add a couple of tablespoons of Marsala, Sweet Sherry or Madeira, then bring back to the boil. Last of all add a couple of tablespoons of cream – any sort – and add the peeled shrimp. </p><p>Serve with warm buttery rolls and you’ll never want for anything more refined!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                     -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
