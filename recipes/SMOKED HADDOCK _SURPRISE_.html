<body><p>pSMOKED HADDOCK ‘SURPRISE’</p><p></p><p> This is such an excellent dish -easy to assemble with readily available ingredients. Served with mash, a dark green vegetable (broccoli?, calabrese?), it’s an elegant and simple dish to present to friends, as well as the two portions presented in this recipe.</p><p>Ingredients: approximately 400ml whole milk (2 teacups); 1 shallot, sliced; 1 bay leaf, a few stalks of parsley; 3 peppercorns; 2 serving portions of smoked haddock (I prefer undyed); 70g strong cheddar, grated; 5 or 6 cherry tomatoes, halved; a handful of breadcrumbs; a little butter; a small amount of cayenne and paprika.</p><p>Method: Heat the milk with the peppercorns, shallot; parsley stalks and bay leaf. When it has begun to simmer, remove from the heat and allow it to stand. Butter a baking dish large enough to contain the fish fillets, and place them in it .Cover them with the cheese, then with the sliced tomatoes. Rewarm the milk, then strain it on to the fish-cheese-tomato mixture. Dot the top with the breadcrumbs, a few sprinkles of cayenne and paprika, then bake it in a hot oven for 20 minutes. Leave it to stand for 5 minutes before serving with the potatoes and veggies.</p><p>Bon appetit!</p><p>                                                                                          -Carla Phillips </p></body></html>
