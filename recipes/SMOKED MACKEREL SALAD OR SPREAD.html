It was usually made with a smoked oily fish from the Great Lakes which was called ‘whitefish’; I’m not sure that this was the proper name. I used to make this out of smoked grey mullet fillets (we smoked this ourselves) but have found that commonly sold smoked mackerel, used in slightly more modest quantities, is a delicious substitute.</p><p>If the salad is all hand chopped, it’s very presentable as a salad. Otherwise, blitz it in a food processor. Then it will serve as a great spread or dip as well as a slightly smoother salad.</p><p>To give this recipe some ‘oomph’ you must use some chilli sauce to add a bit of warmth. Thai Sweet Chili Sauce won’t do for this. It’s too sweet. Use one of the commonly sold Mexican types (I use the widely available ‘Cholula’); or, in a pinch, Tabasco.</p><p>Ingredients: 250g smoked mackerel fillets; 3 blades of celery, finely chopped; 3-4 shallots, finely minced; 1 red or green pepper, very finely chopped; a handful of fresh parsley, chopped; 2-3 tablespoons of mayonnaise; a dash of ground black pepper; 1-2 teaspoons of chilli sauce. </p><p>Method: Remove the skin and any stray bones from the fish fillets and shred them. Combine with the other ingredients. For a finer texture, blitz the lot together, adding the seasonings to taste. Leave to stand for at least an hour to allow the flavours to knit together. Serve with toast or brown bread.</p><p>This is a perfect post-holiday anecdote for a surfeit of meat.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                         -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
