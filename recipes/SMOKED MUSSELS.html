<body><p>SMOKED MUSSELS</p><p></p><p>The last fish smokery in Wells-next-the-Sea closed down in the mid 1960’s and my father-in-law, George Phillips regarded this as a disaster. How would he supply delicious local bloaters for Sunday breakfasts for his customers at The Moorings Hotel in Burnham Overy Staithe?</p><p>His local fishmonger promised him a steady supply of herrings. So he appointed his son Bernard (my late husband) , his assistant at the hotel, as the new chief smoker. Bernard, a literary fellow, borrowed a book on the subject from the library and started straightaway, using an old abandoned brick outhouse opposite the hotel entrance, across the road, in the vegetable garden.</p><p>First try, the fire was too strong, there was too much sawdust and all the fish fell down. Second time, it took too long and the fish seemed hard and tasted too strong. Meanwhile, Bernard stank of smoked fish and was obliged to bathe frequently in order to rid himself of the smell before serving the evening aperitifs,</p><p>But he did master the process in very little time, and years after he had left the hotel, we always had a simple home smokery, albeit reduced in scale. Years later, when we started our restaurant, The Moorings, in Wells, we used an old disused electric cooker. In the bottom of its oven, we set a small metal tray containing sawdust. Above,on a rack, we placed the stuff we wished to smoke.This cooker was located in the back alley of the restaurant until it fell to bits. So then we used a large aluminium oriental steamer. The bottom was seriously holed. Into this, we placed an ancient enamel tray containing the sawdust. We placed a small wire rack containing whatever we wished to smoke on top of the first level of the steamer before using the lid to contain the smoke. This worked like a dream.</p><p>I’m telling you this so that so can improvise your own smoker in order to reproduce the wonderful smoked mussels which Bernard continued to provide until he became too ill.</p><p>It’s simple indeed if you can sort out a smoker and find mussels of the calibre we get in Wells, or on the Norfolk coast. It’s best to do this out-of-doors, even if it’s a city balcony or an alley, but even a fireplace might be good enough to remove any smoky fumes.</p><p>First of all, open your cleaned mussels in a very little water to which you’ve added a heaping tablespoon of salt. When the mussels are just open, remove from the shells and place them upon a wire rack on the tray of your smoker. Sort out the ‘working part’ of the smoker by lighting up a good handful of hard wood sawdust (there are many good sources for these – woodturners, Treen makers, other smokeries…use your ingenuity. Place the tray over the smouldering sawdust, cover the lot, and smoke for 40 minutes. And that is all there is to it.</p><p>These mussels are delicious served with a lemony garlic mayonnaise. Or without!</p><p></p><p>                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
