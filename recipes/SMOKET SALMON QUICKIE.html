<body><p>MEAL IN A HURRY AT HOLIDAY TIME</p><p></p><p>Beside the great set piece meals of Christmas there are numerous meals to prepare when you are in a hurry, the number of diners seem slightly fluid and the will to cook is low. </p><p>A small packet of that lovely hot kiln-smoked salmon from the new shop in  Staithe Street may hold the solution to your problems in these troublesome times.</p><p>You can serve this fish, chopped or crumbled, over scrambled eggs. It’s fine shredded over baked potatoes, served with freshly ground black pepper and a dollop of either crème fraiche or soured cream. </p><p>Another dish, very elegant and simple, is to shred a tablespoon of it per person into a tablespoon of cream. Any sort of cream: fraiche, whipping, soured, double- will do. While this is soaking, cook some tagliatelli, 80-100g per person. When the noodles are cooked, drain and dress them with a small knob of butter. Then stir in the smoked salmon-cream mixture and add some freshly ground pepper or a dot or two of cayenne.</p><p>Voila! Supper is served.</p></body></html>
