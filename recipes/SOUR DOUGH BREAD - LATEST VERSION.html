<body><p>SOUR DOUGH BREAD – NEW VERSION</p><p></p><p>This is the sour dough I am currently making, with all the bells and whistles I have added over the past year. I am not giving a recipe for a starter, as they are widely available; jars of them lingering in many people’s fridges-- I am certainly willing to share mine, as starters are easily divided and brought up to a usable amount by simply adding a couple of tablespoons of flour and enough water to bring it up to a creamy consistency, then leaving it at room temperature overnight..Starter will store well in the fridge, if occasionally renewed by being fed.</p><p></p><p>The process of making this wonderful bread takes time, but very little physical effort. And the result is so delicious, and keeps quite well so that it is very worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: The sour dough starter (you’ll only need a large tablespoon of it – say 50-60g); strong white bread flour – either 500 g, or 450g strong white and 50g of rye or whole wheat flour; 10g salt; 350ml water; a little ground rice (for dusting the final bowl containing the last proving).</p><p>Two medium to large bowls and a heavy-ish casserole with a lid for baking it – a Dutch oven or LeCreuset type casserole should do.</p><p></p><p>1. The night before starting, remove your jar of starter from the fridge. Add a large tablespoon of flour and enough water so that when you stir, it has the consistency of thick cream. Cover the jar and leave it at room temperature until the next day.</p><p>2. Next day, weigh out the flour(s) into a large bowl. Stir in the salt and then all the 350ml of water. Mix briefly and roughly, then cover the bowl with a plastic bag and leave it for an hour.</p><p>3. Now, remove the covering,  and add the sourdough starter (50-60g}. Mix this in roughly and rapidly, then cover it all with the plastic bag. Leave it for another hour.</p><p>4. Now, remove the plastic bag once more. Very gently, pick up a small strand of dough from the side of the bowl. Stretching it gently, pull this over the top of the dough – as though you were wrapping a parcel. Rotate the bowl slightly, then lift another segment of the dough, then stretch it and fold it over. Repeat this stretch and fold movement 23 more times. You should have been round the bowl, - and then some!  This is the most demanding physical effort you will be required to do! Now, cover the bowl once more, and leave it for two hours. But, during this time, repeat the dough folding and stretching- only 8-10 times a session. After the last session, cover the bowl well and leave it for a long time (8-10 hours). The dough should be more than double the size when you look at it. Finally, stretch, pull and fold the dough briefly and lightly – you want to keep those bubbles you’ve made!</p><p>5. Now, find another bowl which you can use for the final rising. Rinse or spray this bowl with water. Dust the whole of the interior with ground rice .Gently place this last bit of folded dough into the bowl. Make sure that the top of the dough has also been covered by sprinkling it with the ground rice. This prevents the loaf from sticking to the bottom of its baking pot and will make it easy to slide the dough into its final destination when baked. Very gently, slide the dough into this well sprinkled bowl, Cover it with the plastic bag and refrigerate it overnight, really anything between 7 and 22 hours.</p><p>6. Preheat your oven to hot (400’ plus). Line your cooking pot or casserole with a piece of parchment or Bakewell paper on the bottom. Remove the dough from the fridge and gently transfer it into the pot. The ground rice makes it easy to tip out when baked. Spray the inside lid with water- and bake 50-60 minutes. Remove from the oven, cool on a rack and don’t break into it until cold!</p><p>                                                                              Carla Phillips</p><p> </p></body></html>
