<body><p>SOURDOUGH BREAD – UPDATE</p><p></p><p>STARTER – Essentially a mixture of flour and water which has fermented enough to contain wild yeasts, this mixture keeps very well, refrigerated in a jar, for about a month or so. However it separates, into a solid sort of mixture on the bottom, and a greyish clear mixture on top. The grey top is of no use – it’s real name is ‘gunk’; it should be discarded, by pouring off down the drain, and more flour and tap water added. To ‘grow’ more starter in a hurry, simply discard the ‘gunk’, add flour and water, in a consistency which resembles cream, and leave the covered jar out at room temperature.</p><p>When you use starter, replace what you have used simply by adding strong flour (white, rye, etc) and water. After several hours, if the liquid smells pleasant, slightly fermented, almost cider like – all is well!</p><p></p><p>THE LOAF- It take a great deal of time, but not much effort. So, start earlyish, the day before you require the bread, if you want to be sure of getting a nicely risen loaf.</p><p>Begin by making your ‘sponge’. For a good sized loaf (you can halve all these ingredients if you want a smaller loaf of bread), weigh 200g starter, 200g warm water and 300g of strong  flour and mix these together well. You can also add a pinch of vitamin C (available in beer-brewing sections at the chemist) which is one ‘improver’ which is useful and non toxic, Stir it well, cover the bowl with a tea towel of cling film and leave it to stand for at least 4 or 5 hours.</p><p>Next go – and add 200g of warm water to the ‘sponge’. Stir it well, then add 500g of flour – and here you can mix up your flours if you like. I usually add some rye and whole wheat flour to strong white- too much brown makes for a heavy loaf, and too little doesn’t taste as interesting. Time for experimentation. Also add 2 teaspoons of salt to the mixture and knead it into a loaf, very briefly. Place this loaf back in its bowl and leave it, lightly covered, for 10 minutes. Now, lihgtly oil a flat surface, and knead the loaf, very briefly, for 10 seconds. (Count –‘One potato, two potato, etc…’). Replace the loaf in the bowl, and repeat this brief kneading at 10 minute intervals two more times. </p><p>Finally mould the loaf into a nice round shape, by first stretching it into a rectangle and then rolling it up, and placing it seam side down on a floured baking sheet.</p><p>Leave this overnight.</p><p>Next day, criss-cross the top of the loaf by slashing it with a razor blade or Stanley-knife blade. Heat your over to a high temperature. When ready to bake, spray it with water (use one of those little plastic spritzer bottles which you can get almost anywhere). Cover the loaf with a large, round metal or ceramic bowl ….possibly a dog’s water bowl. Place this all: tray, loaf, covering bowl – in the oven and bake for  about 30 minutes. Then remove the bowl, and  continue to bake the loaf until it is browning nicely, crisp, and has a slightly hollow sound when tapped lightly.</p><p>Turn the loaf onto a rack to cool.</p><p>                                                                                      -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
