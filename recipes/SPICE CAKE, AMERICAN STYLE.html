<body><p>SPICE CAKE, AMERICAN STYLE</p><p></p><p>I’d been searching for a good recipe for American-style spice cake for many, many years.  A heavenly cake where the spice is present but not too insistent and a streusel (crumble) topping that gives this cake its own icing,  and good texture and taste, this cake was particularly popular in the Mid-West and the South of the US. Various girls in my college dorm were sent versions of this by their mothers; I often looked for recipes of this particular cake which was delicious and had good ‘keeping’ qualities.</p><p>As I said, the combination of spices are not too strong. The nuts add texture and the raisins add moisture. It can be made in either an 8inch or 9inch tin; you can choose between a bigger or taller cake. And, an added advantage; no specialized equipment (mixers, etc)  are required. The only ingredient which is slightly uncommon is buttermilk, which is sold be many supermarkets and any Eastern European shop will always stock it. Buttermilk will last in a fridge for three to four weeks.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 225g plain flour; 115g butter; 280g caster sugar; 1 tsp ground cinnamon; 1 tsp ground nutmeg; ½ tsp ground allspice; 1’2 ground cloves; ½ tsp salt; 120g chopped walnuts; 120g raisins; 200cl buttermilk; 1 large egg; 1 tsp vanilla; ½ tsp bicarb of soda.</p><p>Method: Preheat oven to 370’ (medium hot).Butter and line your cake tin. Pour 200cl of very hot water over the raisins while you get together the rest of the cake.Mix together the flour, sugar, salt and spices. Add the butter and blend it in with the fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs. Then remove and set aside a cupful of this mixture. This will be the cake’s topping. Now, drain the raisins and add this to the rest of the mixture, followed by the walnuts. Mix it together well. Beat the egg lightly with the vanilla and buttermilk. Add the bicarb, mix it all together  then add the wet mixture to the rest of the cake. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin, then sprinkle the reserved dry crumb mixture over the wet mixture in the cake tin. Bake it in for 40 minutes or so – until a sharp knife inserted into the cake comes out dry. When you take it out of the oven, leave it for 10 minutes or so before turning it out of its tin, then cooling..</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
