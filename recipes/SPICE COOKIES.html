<body><p>SPICE COOKIES</p><p></p><p>These are the quick and easy solution to a holiday ‘problem’- of what to offer someone who has casually dropped in for a cup of tea or coffee. Cake? – No, too filling for grownups! Scones- No, a fiddle to prepare!</p><p>The Yankees have it right this time. A homemade biscuit- ‘cookies’, as we call them, is the perfect answer. And this following recipe is quick and simple to prepare. Once made, it also stores well in a tin or tightly lidded plastic box. The taste, redolent of spice and butter, is somehow appropriate for this season.</p><p>Ingredients: 110g plain flour; ½ tsp ground cinnamon; ½ tsp ground cardoman; dash of ground black pepper; dash of salt (if you use unsalted butter); ½ tsp bicarb (baking soda); 1and1/2 tsp warm water; 1and1/2 tsp dark treacle (or molasses);90g butter (softened, or at room temperature); 90g caster sugar.</p><p>Method: Preheat oven to medium hot . Mix together, very roughly, the flour and dry spices. Stir the bicarb into the warm water, then add the dark treacle. Now, cream the butter with the sugar, add the treacle mixture, then stir in the flour-spice mixture. Form approximately in teaspoonsfull into small balls, and place on  silicon (Bakewell paper) lined baking sheets, well apart. You should have about two dozen. Flatten these little balls by mashing them, in a criss-cross pattern, with the tines of a fork. If it seems a little sticky, dip your fork into flour. Bake these for 10-12 minutes. Cool on a rack before storing. </p><p>Happy Holidays!</p><p>                                                                                   -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
