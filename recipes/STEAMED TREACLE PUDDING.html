<body><p>STEAMED TREACLE PUDDING</p><p></p><p>My husband’s aunty owned and ran an upmarket hotel in Sutton Surrey from the 1930s until the mid ‘60s. She knew an awful lot about cookery. But, this was ‘Cook’s’ recipe, which had been used since Edwardian times. Her treacle sponge was incredibly popular; the grated apple and lemon flavourings cut through the extreme sweetness of the syrup. When I made it in our restaurant, using vegetarian suet (which I found to be lighter than the regular version), it was in constant demand. It can be made in a single pudding bowl or decanted into smaller bowls suitable for turning out as individual servings. This recipe will serve 4 or 5, and can always be re-steamed or heated in a microwave.</p><p>Ingredients: 120g self raising flour; 1 teaspoon baking powder; pinch of salt; 120g soft breadcrumbs; 1 level tablespoon brown sugar; 120g suet; 1 medium cooking apple, peeled and grated; zest of ½ lemon; 2 eggs; 2 eggs; juice of ½ lemon; 60ml milk; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 100ml golden syrup.</p><p>Method: Sift the flour, baking powder and pinch of salt together into a largish bowl. Add the breadcrumbs, the brown sugar, lemon zest and apple, then mix it again. Now, in a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Add the juice of the half lemon, the milk, vanilla and the golden syrup. Mix this into the dryer ingredients and spoon it into your pudding basin or individual little bowls. Cover with greaseproof or foil sheets of paper, which have a central pleated fold, so that the can expand as the puddings are cooked. You can anchor these papers with an elastic band.</p><p>Steam for 40 minutes. Turn out while still hot and serve with some golden syrup, warmed and diluted with juice from the remaining half lemon.</p><p>                                                                                                    -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
