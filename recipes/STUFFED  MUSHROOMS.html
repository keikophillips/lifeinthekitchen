Wonderfully large mushrooms are available widely, and they are super when stuffed before cooking. Indeed, a single large stuffed mushroom is an ample, economic dish for one person. The following recipe is popular with family and friends as well as past customers.</p><p></p><p>First, however, a simple tomato sauce is required. I suppose that at a pinch you could buy one of those available in jars, but it’s simple enough to make.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 1 dessertspoon of olive oil; a small onion, finely chopped; 1 small clove of garlic, minced; 1 teaspoon of sugar; a small tin of tomatoes (any sort); ½ teaspoon of dried oregano; salt and pepper.</p><p>Method: Gently fry the onion in the olive oil, then add the garlic. Next, tip in the tin of tomatoes and also a tinful of water as well as the sugar and the oregano. Simmer this sauce for about 15 minutes, then season to taste. If you like your sauces smoooth, you can always blitz it with a blender, stick blender or processor.</p><p></p><p>Now, for the mushrooms.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: For each large mushroom- 1 sausage (I particularly like Arthur Howell’s venison sausages for this recipe}, ½ slice of bread. Soaked briefly in water, then squeezed; the stem of the mushroom you’re stuffing; a small shallot and half a clove of garlic; ½ teaspoon of fennel seeds or a small chunk of fresh fennel; a little salt and pepper. </p><p>Method: Blitz  these ingredients together. Pile them into the mushroom cap. Spoon a little tomato sauce in to a deep enough baking dish to contain the mushroom{s}. Cover with more of the tomato sauce/ Cover this dish lightly with aluminium foil, then bake it in a medium oven for 30-40 minutes. This is great served with either mash or pasta, and looks fine accompanied with very green greens, such as spring cabbage, calabrese or even sprouts.</p></body></html>
