Pulverized – zapped- with a few trickles of added oil, it is a handy sauce to serve with barbecued, grilled or roasted oily fish.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 10 small cooked beetroot, cooked in their skin; 1 tablespoon of horseradish cream or sauce; 300ml cider vinegar; 100g sugar; 1 bay leaf; 1 teaspoon salt; a few peppercorns; 1 tablespoon of chopped dill; 1 or 2 onions, thinly sliced.</p><p>Method: Peel and slice the beetroot. Put the rest of the ingredients into a saucepan and bring them to the boil. Then add the sliced beetroot and when it is once more boiling, leave it to bubble away for 2-3 minutes. Then pour it into clean, warmed jars. Leave it to cool before refrigerating.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                    -Carla Phillips</p><p></p><p>                                                               </p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
