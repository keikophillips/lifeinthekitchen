<body><p>TECHNICOLOUR! -BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP</p><p></p><p>Bright orange, its high colour emboldened by the turmeric in the curry seasoning, the blazing appearance of this soup conceals its simplicity. Easy to make – not as rich as it looks- it is very cheering at a dark and dank winter mealtime.</p><p>Ingredients:1 smallish butternut squash, peeled, de-cored, chopped into bits;  medium onion, sliced;  tblsp vegetable oil; 1-2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped; 1 red chilli, de-seeded, ribs removed, then chopped; 1 walnut-sized peeled segment of ginger, either chopped or coarsely grated; 1 level tsp of ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric and mild curry powder; juice of 1 ½  limes; salt and pepper. A dollop of Greek yogurt and freshly chopped green coriander,  when serving.</p><p>Method: Heat a soup-sized saucepan, then add the oil. Throw in the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry these for a minute. Now, add the onion and the spices, and cook for five minutes or so, stirring occasionally. Now add the squash and stir it all about; Lower the heat, cover the pan and cook for about ten minutes occasionally stirring. Raise the heat under the pan, and add enough water to completely cover all the veggies .Bring this to the boil, then lower the heat, cover once again and cook for 15-20 minutes until the squash is soft and cooked.</p><p>\\\\\remove the pan from the fire and zap it well with a stick blender, normal blender or food processor. Add the lime juice, taste it, then season with salt and pepper to your liking, </p><p>When you serve it, finish it off with a dollop of yogurt and the chopped fresh coriander.</p><p>                                                                                                   -Carla Phillips  </p></body></html>
