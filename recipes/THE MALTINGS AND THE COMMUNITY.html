<body><p>THE MALTINGS AND THE COMMUNITY</p><p></p><p>June 6th, 2021</p><p></p><p>Yesterday,   I wondered whether there were any spare tickets for the piano recitals scheduled at the Maltings. It was late morning on the Saturday – and I would have been happy with either tickets for that afternoon or return tickets for the day following, which had been advertised as sold out. So, I rang the Maltings. The answerphone told me that the box office was open during the weekdays and Saturday. Since it was Saturday, I rang once more in the hope that the phone might be answered. No chance. Examining the ‘What’s On’ leaflet there was the suggestion that I book through ‘nnmf’ – the North Norfolk Music Festival. No phone number was given. Useless!</p><p>Why am I telling you this? It’s because this sort of thing happens all too often/ The Maltings continues to lurch from glitch to mishap without hesitation.</p><p>So why ask for suggestions about community relations. Particularly with an emphasis on the local parents and the schools. It seems silly since the person originally hired to do this job, who actually did it splendidly, was dismissed. The disregard to all of the community projects which were welcomed by the parents and schools, which were valued highly by Ofstead school inspectors and acclaimed by the BBC, were ignored by the management at the Maltings. Indeed, except for one small event at the Maltings itself, the events held in the schools, well attended by parents of this community, were not ever visited by a single trustee, as far as I can tell.</p><p>This rankled with the community at large.</p><p>Ordinary Wells people have long complained of not being listened to when suggesting things. Workshops, Craft Fairs, Mini Craft Courses, a piano in the foyer (like St Pancras), Art classes..even a book exchange...all suggestions are met with cold politeness which masks arrogant hostility.There is a feeling that the Maltings is the Keeper of a Culture which is to be doled out to the deserving.</p><p>The publicity is a joke. No posters or flyers in the surrounding villages. No efforts to link up with the neighbouring communities.No notices for children to bring home. </p><p>I note that the return address is in Barnstaple. Why there? If this is about Wells, why has it come from afar? Is this the work of a distant commercial firm? Only asking….</p><p></p><p>                                                                                                      Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
