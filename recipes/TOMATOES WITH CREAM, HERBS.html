<body><p></p><p>ON ITS OWN OR AS AN ACCOMPANIMENT</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here is a little dish which is wonderful served as a vegetable on its own. But is delightful accompanying several other, very plainly cooked, ingredients: steamed veg, roasted chicken or steamed fish…</p><p>It’s not elegant or smooth enough to classify as a sauce, but serves the same purpose: put together with simple ingredients, it will ‘lift’ even the simplest meal. And its made of that widely available summer ingredient: fresh tomatoes. The little sorts of tomatoes, commonly grown by many of us, are simply perfect. </p><p>The weight called for does not have to be exact, This is not an exact formula to inscribe on stone. It’s the method of cooking (very rapid) which counts here.</p><p>Ingredients: approximately 250g (1/2 lb) of small tomatoes, sliced in half; 1 spring onion or shallot, finely chopped; 1 teaspoon (a walnut sized lump) of butter; salt and pepper; 2 tablespoons of white wine (I use Vermouth- it’s cheap and doesn’t go off rapidly);  1 tablespoon of either chopped fresh tarragon or dill or fennel; 1 tablespoon of cream.</p><p>Method: Heat up a smallish frying pan. Then put the shallots or spring onion in with the butter, followed by the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the wine. When this is on the boil, add the cream, and as soon as it amalgamates and starts to reduce (very quickly, you’ll find), add the herbs. </p><p>And that’s it.  You can put a serving dish containing this in a very low, warming oven, where it will stand for 15 minutes. Which gives you time to assemble the rest of your meal.</p><p>                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p><p></p></body></html>
