<body><p>TURKEY TETRAZZINI</p><p></p><p>This delicious combination of pasta and turkey was a big deal in the 1950s. Named after famous opera singer Luisa Tetrazzini by a Californian chef anxious to please her, the recipe originally called for poached chicken. Like so many great dishes of that time, imitations and ‘instant’ versions of the dish gradually debased this wonderful recipe, well worthy of revival. Nowadays it’s a post Christmas star, its quality rising and falling upon the nature of the stock made from the leftover bird.</p><p>So, to make a good turkey stock use the bones, any broth or gravy you already have, together with a chopped large carrot, onion, stick or two of celery and a couple of cloves of garlic. Place these all in a large saucepan, together with a couple of bay leaves, a few peppercorns and a couple of cloves.Bring it all to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer it all together for a good hour. </p><p>Then, remove from the heat and sieve the stock into a bowl, discarding the solids. Return the liquid to the stove, and cook once more, boiling until it’s reduced to about 300-250ml.</p><p>To complete the dish you will need 350g sliced mushrooms;60g butter; 3 tablespoons of sherry (any sort); 150cl cream; 2 tablespoons of plain flour; 250g spaghetti; salt and pepper; leftover turkey meat cut into smallish pieces; 30-40g grated parmesan</p><p>Method: Make the sauce by melting half the butter, then adding the flour then adding the hot, reduced stock. Bring this to a boil, stirring the while. Reduce the heat, and allow to simmer very gently for 5 minutes. Then add the cream and sherry and season to taste.</p><p>Cook the spaghetti until it’s ‘al dente’, Drain and rinse quickly to prevent the strands from sticking together. Saute the sliced mushrooms in the rest of the butter. Then toss the spaghetti and mushrooms together with half of the sauce. Place this in a fairly large casserole or roasting tin. Stir the turkey into the remaining sauce, make a depression in the spag-mushroom mixture and spoon the turkey into it. Cover it with the grated parmesan and bake in a moderate to hottish oven for 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</p><p>The original recipe called for chopped truffles over it all- which isn’t particularly practical for present day cooks- but if you were given a bottle of truffle oil as a present, now is the time for a dribble of it over the dish as it comes out of the oven.</p><p>This recipe makes enough to serve 8-10 people—and if it seems too great an amount, it does freeze nicely</p><p></p></body></html>
