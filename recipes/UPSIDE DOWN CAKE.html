<body><p>- UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE</p><p></p><p>This is a great use for some of the fine stone fruit available during the summer time. In winter, tinned or bottled fruit, including tinned pineapple, also works well.</p><p>Use apricots, peaches, plums, cut in half with the stones removed. As it is reversed onto its serving dish, remember this when placing your fruit in the cooking pan. Traditionally cooked in a heavy-bottomed skillet or frying pan with an ovenproof handle, I possess nothing suitable, so use an ordinary 9 inch (23cm) cake tin, lightly oiled and lined on the bottom with Bakewell (silicon) paper. When I turn the cake onto its platter, the results look good, even if my fingers may get a bit sticky during the reversal, peeling off the paper.</p><p>Preheat your oven to low to moderate (approx 325-350F – 170-180C)</p><p>Ingredients: 130g butter; 200g brown sugar; a punnet of apricots, peaches or plums – more if you like your fruit crowded together, as I do; 4 eggs, separated; 180g caster sugar; 120g self-raising flour; 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract; a pinch of salt</p><p>Method: In a heavy-ish saucepan, melt the butter. Before continuing further, set aside 3 teaspoons of this melted butter in a little container. Now, add the brown sugar into your saucepan. Stir until the sugar is well dissolved and only just beginning to bubble slightly. Remove this from the heat and our it into the cake tin. Now, distribute your halved and stoned fruit on top of this.</p><p>And now for the batter itself. Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff. Gradually add the caster sugar, meringue fashion.</p><p>Now, beat the egg yolks well. Add the 3 teaspoons of melted butter, then the vanilla. Fold this into the meringue mixture. Last of all sift and fold the self-raising flour into the meringue and yolk mixture. Pour this batter over the fruit mixture in the baking tin and bake it for 30-40 minutes, until it’s a lovely golden brown and the middle doesn’t wobble when lightly poked.</p><p>Reverse it onto a serving dish. It’s great when hot but also fine served cold or even gently reheated. Serve with cream, ice cream or a fruit fool.</p><p>                                                                                          -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
