<body><p>WALNUT AND CHEDDAR BISCUITS</p><p></p><p>Here are some deliciously savoury biscuits using Fairtrade Walnuts, These are easily assembled, perfect as a simple snack, served with drinks or as part of a ‘finger-food’ buffet. They keep for a week or two in an airtight tin. </p><p>These take minutes to make if you have a food-processor. If not, grate or chop your nuts very finely.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 125g butter, softened; 250g grated cheddar; pinch of salt; 1/2teaspoon of cayenne; 90g flour; 90g walnuts; 1 egg yolk</p><p></p><p>Method: Blend these ingredients well, either in a machine or by hand. Chill for a half hour. Then, drop them in teaspoon-sized portions, well apart, on parchment lined (Bakewell) baking sheets. With a piece of Cling film, flatten them into disks.</p><p>Bake at 180C (Gas4) until they are golden – about 15 minutes – then cool on a rack.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                            -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
