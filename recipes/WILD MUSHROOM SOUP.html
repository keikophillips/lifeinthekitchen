    <h1>WILD MUSHROOM SOUP</h1>
    <p></p><p>Some former customers of mine reminisced about driving up for a  Wells weekend, starting with a meal at our restaurant, anticipating a bowl of this particular soup. It was very popular,  with a substantial taste and rich texture which far exceeded its relatively simple ingredients. I still make this frequently, especially when the weather is grim.</p><p></p><p>Ingredients: 500g onions, halved and very thinly sliced; 1-2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely minced; 1 tablespoon of dried wild mushrooms (porcini); 250g mushrooms (very large ones or brown ‘chestnut’ ones taste best) finely sliced; 20g butter; 1 tablespoon of olive oil; 1 tablespoon of soy sauce; 1 tablespoon of sweet sherry or Marsala; 1 tablespoon of tomato puree; 300ml milk; 2 tablespoons of cream; salt and pepper; a little chopped parsley for a garnish.</p><p></p><p>Method: First of all, soak the dried mushrooms in about a teacup of boiling water, leaving them to stand while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Then, heat an empty heavy bottomed saucepan. Throw in the sliced onions, stirring wells as they start to steam and colour. Then add the butter and olive oil, and reduce the heat under them. Stir briefly, then cover and leave it all to gently cook until the onions are a rich golden brown. Now, pump up the heat and add the sliced fresh mushrooms. Stir well, then add the garlic. Strain the soaking (previously dried) mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid. Add these mushrooms to the other ingredients, mixing well. Next, add the soy sauce, sherry or Marsala, tomato puree and the soaking liquid and enough water to cover all these ingredients by about 2 inches. Simnmer this gently for about 30 minutes and then add the milk. Season to taste and finally add the cream. Garnish with a little finely chopped parsley and serve with some crusty bread.</p><p></p><p>                                                                                  -Carla Phillips</p>
