    <p>WARMING SOUPS</p><p></p><p>.In an icy winter my usual strategy is to make thick vegetable soups which ‘do’ for several meals. Buying myself a stick blender (an inexpensive stout zapper which pulverizes easily and quickly) has made this an easy task. Schlepping hot mixtures from the saucepan into the blender or food processor tends to be fraught and messy. Plungeing  this little machine directly into the cooking pot- with its detachable, quickly washed out business end, has made life considerably easier. </p><p>And so to the soups themselves/ Basically, most soups start with the sauteing (or gentle frying) of onions – or several of their relatives such as leeks, shallots, spring onions, together with a potato or two. The potato adds the thickish, slightly velvety texture. From then on, you can add as much or as little as you please. You can add a little curry powder, or garlic,chilli and ginger. You can add herbs. You can throw in most vegetables: beetroot, carrots, root vegetables, squashes, celery, etc. You can certainly add any cooked leftover vegetables to hand.</p><p>Next comes stock. I use a combination of vegetable water and commercial vegetable stock powder (‘Marigold’is my preference). But you can add chicken, ham, game or beef stock, if that’s what you have and like.</p><p>But, that absolutely basic mixture of onion and potato is perfectly fine on its own. A good friend who spent a winter studying in Lisbon told me of the regular, delicious starter served up by his Portugese landlady each night.</p><p>She started bu heating up a largish saucepan, to which she added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. She cut up either one large or two medium onions which she added to the oil. Then she peeled a large potato, chopped it up and added that. She then turned down the fire under the pot, covered it, and only occasionally stirred it until the potatoes had started to soften.</p><p>To this, she added vegetable stock (about 500ml). This was brought to the boil and simmered until the potato was entirely soft. Then she removed the saucepan from the heat and shredded, very finely, some dark green cabbage or kale. </p><p>The soup was then liquidized and returned to the stove, to reheat. The shredded cabbage was chucked in to cook for barely two or three minutes, and then the soup was served. Sometimes a slice or two of chorizo or sausage went on top as a garnish, but this wasn’t an everyday occurrence.</p><p>Try this. It’s simple, cheap and tasty and helps combat those chilly winter blues.</p><p>                                                                                -Carla Phillips</p>
