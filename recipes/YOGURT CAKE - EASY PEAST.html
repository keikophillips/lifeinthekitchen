<body><p>AMERICAN YOGURT CAKE-EASY PEASY!</p><p></p><p>I’d heard about this cake, made without using machinery in less than 15 minutes. It’s baked in a loaf tin, easy to slice, easy to store. With plenty of add-on variations. And, no machinery or muscle power is required. The loaf tin needs to be greased and dusted with flour or use one of those cheap widely available frilly paper moulds, expressly designed for this job. All you really need is two bowls, which don’t even have to be the same size.</p><p>Ingredients: 220g self raising flour;1 tsp baking powder; 7g salt; 150g caster sugar; the grated zest of a lemon; 100ml vegetable oil; 170g whole milk Greek yogurt; 2 eggs; ½ tsp vanilla extract.</p><p>Method: Preheat oven to 180’c. Grease and flour the tin. Weigh the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Mix them lightly. In the other bowl, rub the lemon zest into the sugar till it is slightly moist. Then add the yogurt, oil, eggs, vanilla. Whisk them all briefly, before folding in the dry ingredients. Pour it into the baking tin, smoothing the top and bake until the top of the cake is golden and a toothpick or skewer inserted into the cake comes out dry (45-55 minutes). Let the cake cool in the tin for 15 minutes before inverting it onto a rack.</p><p>You can omit the lemon zest and add more vanilla. Or, at the last moment, fold in chopped nuts, raisins or other dried fruit, chocolate chips….I iced the lemon cake with icing sugar stirred into warm lemon juice...possibilities are endless.</p><p>                                                                               -Carla Phillips</p></body></html>
